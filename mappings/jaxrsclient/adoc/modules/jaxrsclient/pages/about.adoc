Consider the use case where an Apache Isis app emits "thin" events to an ESB, for example using the xref:mappings:outbox-publisher:about.adoc[Outbox Publisher].
The ESB then queries back to the Apache Isis app to get extra info in a canonical DTO form in order to continue processing.

TIP: for more on this use case, try searching on "link:https://www.google.com/search?q=fat+vs+thin+events[fat vs thin events]".

This library, then, provides a bit of code to construct the correct `Accept-Type` headers, in a format that is then interpreted by an application-specific implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/conmap/ContentMappingService.adoc[ContentMappingService].
