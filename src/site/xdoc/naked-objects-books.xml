            <p>Although it has evolved since, Apache Isis framework started out as an
               open source implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects">naked objects pattern</a>.
               In fact, the dynamically generated webapp is a naked objects system; the dynamically generated
               RESTful API can also be considered as a naked objects system (it's just that the representation is not intended
               by users, instead by machines).
            </p>
            <p>
                If the idea of naked objects is of interest, then there are a couple of books on the topic that you might want to read.
            </p>

			<h3>Naked Objects</h3>

			<p>
				<i>Richard Pawson and Robert Matthews, Wiley 2002</i>
			</p>

				src="images/nakedobjects-book.jpg" style="margin:0 20px 20px 0; border-style:solid; border-width:1px;" />
			<p>This book describes the original ideas of Naked Objects. Although
				based on a very early version of the framework, it's still
				definitely worth a read (and beautifully produced).</p>

			<p>Amazon quotes: (avg 5 stars)</p>
			<ul style="padding-left: 20px">
				<li>
					<cite>Brilliant argument and toolkit for information systems</cite>
				</li>
				<li>
					<cite>Most thoughtful and beautiful technical book I have read
					</cite>
				</li>
				<li>
					<cite>Excellent presentation of an innovative practical idea</cite>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The book is freely available online
				<a href="http://www.nakedobjects.org/book/">here</a>
				. Or, you can
				get a hardcopy of the book at
				<a
					href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470844205.html">Wiley (publisher)</a>
				and

			<h3>Domain Driven Design using Naked Objects</h3>

			<p>
				<i>Dan Haywood, Pragmatic Bookshelf 2009</i>
			</p>

			<img align="left" alt="Domain Driven Design using Naked Objects"
				class="wrap-left" src="images/dhnako.jpg"
				style="margin:0 20px 20px 0; border-style:solid; border-width:1px;" />

			<p>This more recent book draws the parallel between domain-driven
				design and Naked Objects (4.0). In the spirit of the Pragmatic
				Bookshelf, it's a practical, hands-on
				sort of book, building up a
				case study as it goes and encouraging you to
				build your own app as
				you go.</p>

			<p>Amazon quotes: (avg 4.5 stars)</p>
			<ul style="padding-left: 20px">
				<li>
					<cite>Important Contribution to Domain-Driven Design</cite>
				</li>
				<li>
					<cite>The easy-to-learn Naked Objects Framework .. provide[s] a
						masterful exposition on DDD</cite>
				</li>
				<li>
					<cite>Clear and passionate book about a great subject</cite>
				</li>
