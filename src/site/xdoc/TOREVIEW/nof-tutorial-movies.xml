			<h3>Tutorial Movies</h3>
			<p>
				The following movies show briefly how the GUI provided by [[NAME]]
				Objects relates to the underlying code.
				In these examples, we show
				the application running on the
				<a href="./plugins/dnd-viewer/index.html">DnD viewer</a>
				for desktop
				deployments. Remember though that [[NAME]] supports
				several different
				viewers, including several different viewers for
				webapps.

						Note that the discussion about the
						<tt>resolve()</tt>
						and
						<tt>objectChanged()</tt>
						calls relates to NOF 3.0; in NOF 4.0 these method calls can be
						omitted
						(we use cglib or javassist proxies to do the dirtying and lazy
						loading
						instead).
