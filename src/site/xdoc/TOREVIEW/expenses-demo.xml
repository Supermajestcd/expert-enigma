    <section name="Expenses Processing - Demonstration application"><p>This
    demonstration application, written in [[NAME]], allows you to create
    and process expense claims. It is a much-simplified version of the kind of
    expense processing application found in many organisations. (As the full
    source-code of this demonstration is included with the [[NAME]]
    download, you might like to consider extending/modifying it to meet your
    own organisation's expense processing requirements.)</p><subsection
    name="Registering and logging-in"></subsection><p>To use the application
    you will first need to <a
    href="http://demo.isis.apache.org/register/create-user.jsp">register a
    new user</a>. This will allow you to create a new claim. If you want to be
    able to submit and approve claims then you will need to register more than
    one user - however, you can register the additional users at any
    stage.</p><p>Having registered at least one user, you may use the
    application through one of two different user interfaces. The first is a
    pure HTML user interface, run from within your browser (we recommend using
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> or <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx">Internet
    Explorer 7</a>).</p><ul>
        <li><a href="http://demo.isis.apache.org/expenses/">Login to the HTML
        demo</a></li>
      </ul><p>The second is a rich-client interface, which adopts the 'desktop
    metaphor' and uses 'drag and drop' gestures. It is launched via <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/download.jsp">Java
    WebStart</a>. (Note: this demo is running client-server over the public
    internet. Performance is very dependent upon connection speed. The
    rich-client interface is intended for use primarily within an intranet,
    where it works very well).</p><ul>
        <li><a href="http://demo.isis.apache.org/webstart/">Login to the
        rich-client demo</a></li>
      </ul><subsection name="Screen movies"></subsection><p>For guidance on
    how to use the application via each interface, we have provided a series
    of three short screen-movies for each user interface. These are in <a
    href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/">Shockwave</a>
    format.</p><p>Screen movies for the rich-client user interface:</p><ul>
        <li><a
        href="movies/Retrieving and viewing a Claim (DND UI).htm">Retrieving
        claims</a></li>

        <li><a
        href="movies/Creating and submitting a new Claim (DND UI).htm">Creating
        and submitting a new claim</a></li>

        <li><a href="movies/Approving claims (DND UI).htm">Approving a
        claim</a></li>
      </ul><p>Screen movies for the HTML user interface:</p><ul>
        <li><a
        href="movies/Retrieving and viewing a Claim (HTML UI).htm">Retrieving
        claims</a></li>

    change Password?</a></p><p>Forgotten your username(s) or password? <a
    href="http://demo.isis.apache.org/register/reset-password.jsp">Enter your
    email address</a> and we'll send you the user name(s) using that email
    address, with reset passwords.</p></section>
