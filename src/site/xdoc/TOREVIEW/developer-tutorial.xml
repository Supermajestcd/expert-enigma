    <section name="How [[NAME]] applications are built"><h3>A closer look
    at the Expenses Processing demo application</h3> <p>If you haven't already
    done so, run the online demo of our simple <a
    href="../demo/index.shtml">Expenses Processing</a> application.</p> <p>The
    full source code of this application is included with the [[NAME]]
    download, and there is a section of the [[NAME]] Application
    Development Manual (also included), which looks in detail at how that
    application is written. However, for a rapid overview, run these two
    screen movies (requires <a
    href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/">Shockwave</a>):</p> <ul>
        <li><a href="movies/Anatomy of a [[NAME]].htm">Anatomy of a [[NAME]]
        Object</a></li>

        <li><a href="movies/Actions.htm">Object Actions</a></li>
      </ul> <h3>Building a simple application from scratch</h3> <p>Follow the
    steps in this <a href="movies/first-app.htm">screen movie</a> to create
    your first simple [[NAME]] application within just a few minutes.
    (The movie shows the application being developed within Eclipse, but the
    same principles apply for any development environment).</p></section>
