WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

This guide describes the authentication and authorization features available to secure your Apache Isis application.






== Terminology

// TODO:v2: these words could perhaps move into the "security API" module, currently empty.

Apache Isis has built-in support for authentication and authorization:

* By "authentication" we mean logging into the application using some credentials, typically a username and password.
Authentication also means looking up the set of roles to which a user belongs.

* By "authorization" we mean permissions: granting roles to have access to features (object member) of the app.

Apache Isis has two levels of permissions.
_Read_ permission means that the user can view the object member; it will be rendered in the UI.  An action with only read permission will be shown disabled ("greyed out".
_Write_ permission means that the object member can be changed.  For actions this means that they can be invoked.

//WARNING: TODO: v2: this is out of date, because there is also a keycloak integration.

The framework provides an API for both authentication and authorization, and provides an implementation that integrates with link:http://shiro.apache.org[Apache Shiro].
Shiro in turn uses the concept of a _realm_ as a source for both authentication and optionally authorization.

//WARNING: TODO: v2: Spring Boot requires that shiro.ini is on classpath, not in WEB-INF.

Shiro ships with a simple text-based realm -- the `IniRealm` -- which reads users (and password), user roles and role permissions from the `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` file.
The xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld] and xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps are both configured to use this realm.

Shiro also ships with an implementation of an LDAP-based realm; LDAP is often used to manage user/passwords and corresponding user groups.
Apache Isis in turn extends this with its `IsisLdapRealm`, which provides more flexibility for both group/role and role/permissions management.

In addition, the xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[SecMan extension] provides an implementation of the Shiro `Realm` API.
This extension also represents users, roles and permissions as domain objects, allowing them to be administered through Apache Isis itself.
Moreover, it can also optionally delegate password management to a subsidiary (delegate) realm (usually LDAP as discussed above).

In addition to Apache Isis' Shiro-based implementation of its authentication and authorization APIs, Isis also provides a "bypass" implementation, useful for quick-n-dirty prototyping when you want to in effect disable (bypass) security completely.

[NOTE]
.What about auditing?
====
A further aspect of security is auditing: recording what data was modified by which user.

Apache Isis provides the xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`]
can be used to track the actions being invoked, and the xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`]
captures what data was modified as a result (auditing).
When ``Interaction``s are persisted (eg by way of the xref:mappings:outbox-publisher:about.adoc[Outbox Publisher] mapping module) then this provides excellent
traceability.
The xref:security:audit-trail:about.adoc[Auditer] module provides an implementation of the `AuditerService`.

For xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] can be also be used to capture actions, for example using the xref:extensions:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] extension.
