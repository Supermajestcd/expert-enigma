The bypass implementation, as its name suggests, allows both authentication and authorization to be bypassed.

This is typically used for integration tests or for prototyping.

== Configuring to use Bypass

The bypass security component consists of an implementation of both the `AuthenticationManager` and `AuthorizationManager` APIs, and are intended for prototyping use only.

The authentication manager allows access with any credentials (in a sense, "bypassing" authentication), while the authorization manager provides access to all class members (in a sense, "bypassing" authorization).



To tell Apache Isis to bypass security, use the appropriate `IsisModuleSecurityBypass` in the xref:userguide:fun:modules.adoc[app manifest].

[source,ini]
----
isis.authentication=bypass
isis.authorization=bypass
----

This installs the appropriate no-op implementations for both authentication and authorization:
