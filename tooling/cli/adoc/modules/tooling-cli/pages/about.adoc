Command Line Interface for the _Apache Isis Tooling_ ecosystem, to generate documentation from program sources (`.java` files, `pom.xml`, etc).



== Prerequisites

From the root of the git repo, build the tooling using Java 11:

[source,java]
----
mvn install -D module-tooling -Dskip.essential
----

This will generate the command line CLI as an executable jar in its target directory (`tooling/cli/target`).


== Available Commands

Use the help command to see a list of available commands:

[source]
.calling for help
----
java -jar tooling/cli/target/isis-tooling-cli.jar --help
----

which (currently) generates the following:

[source]
----
Usage: cli [-hV] [-o=<outputPath>] [-p=<projectRootPath>] [COMMAND]
CLI for the Apache Isis Tooling Ecosystem
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -o, --output=<outputPath>
                  path to the output file (default: NONE = write to std.out)
  -p, --project=<projectRootPath>
                  path to the (multi-module) project root (default: current dir)
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  projdoc   Writes all generated (AsciiDoc) to given output.
  overview  Writes a System Overview document (AsciiDoc) to given output.
  index     Writes a Global Index (AsciiDoc) to given output.
----

The "projdoc" command is the usual command to use, as it performs both the "overview" and "index" commands.

By default, the current directory is used as the target to perform commands in.


=== Configuration File

The `isis-tooling.yml` configuration file (found in the root of the repo) provides default options for each command, as well as global defaults applicable to all commands:

[source,yml]
.isis-tooling.yml
----
global: # <.>
  option ...
  option ...
command:
  overview: # <.>
    ...
  index:    # <.>
    ...
----

<.> configuration applicable to all commands
<.> configuration for the "overview" command (also used by the "projdoc" command)
<.> configuration for the "index" command (also used by the "projdoc" command)

TIP: This configuration file is mapped onto the `CLIConfig` bean.
Inspect its https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/tooling/cli/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/tooling/cli/CliConfig.java#L31[source code] for more detailed information.


== Commands

All commands accept two parameters:

* `-p` indicates the location of the multi-project root `pom.xml`
+
in other words, the root of the git repo.

* `-o` the output target root for generated _adoc_

These are specified first in the command line.
The command is then specified, along with any command-specific options.

A number of global configuration options can be specified under the `global` entry in the `isis-tooling.yml` file.

[source,yml]
.isis-tooling.yml
----
global:
  outputRootFolder:                                                       # <.>
  licenseHeader: "Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) ..."   # <.>
  documentPagesPath: "pages"                                              # <.>
  namespacePartsSkipCount: 3                                              # <.>
  sections:                                                               # <.>
    App: org.apache.isis.app.*
    Mavendeps: org.apache.isis.mavendeps.*
    ...
    Core: org.apache.isis.core.*
    Persistence: org.apache.isis.persistence
    JDO: "org.apache.isis.persistence:isis-persistence-jdo.*"
    JPA: "org.apache.isis.persistence:isis-persistence-jpa.*"
    ...
----

<.> the output target root for generated _adoc_; corresponds to command line option `-o` (if empty the current dir is used)
<.> license header to include with each generated adoc file
<.> sub-folder name for _adoc_ pages
<.> how many namespace parts in a _fqn_ one wants to skip, eg. in `org.apache.isis.applib.Xxx` if we skip 3 namespace parts we'll end up with `applib.Xxx`
<.> Logical grouping of modules for the system overview, but also used to determine which modules to scan for index files.
+
If not specified the natural Maven project hierarchy is reflected as is.

The `sections` configuration key is used to group module artifacts into named sections.
It consists of key:value pairs:

* the key is the section name (eg "App", or "JDO")
* the value is a pattern that identifies Maven artifacts.

This pattern in turn can be either:

* an exact Maven `groupId`, such as `org.apache.isis.persistence`
+
This matches all Maven modules with exactly that `groupId`.

* a Maven `groupId` with wildcard, such as `org.apache.isis.core.*`
+
This matches all Maven modules whose `groupId` pattern matches the groupId.

* a Maven group and artifact optionally with wildcard, such as `org.apache.isis.persistence:isis-persistence-jdo.*`
+
This matches all Maven modules whose `groupId` pattern equals the specified groupId and whose `artifactId` pattern matches the specified `artifactId`.

If a Maven module matches more than one section, then the more specific section (with both group and artifact) is used.

These different types of sections are exploited by the `overview` command, described <<system-overview-overview,below>>.

=== Project documentation (`projdoc`)

This command generates both a <<system-overview-overview,system overview>> and generates the <<index-index,global index>>, and as such is the command that you will probably want to use most of the time.
See those two commands for further details.


==== Usage

The `projdoc` command is usually invoked as follows:

[source]
----
java -jar tooling/cli/target/isis-tooling-cli.jar \
    -p . \
    -o antora/components/system/modules/generated \
    projdoc
----

where :

* `-p` and `-o` are the global options for all commands

* `projdoc` selects this sub-command

There are no command-specific options.


[[projdoc-configuration]]
==== Configuration

The `projdoc` command has no specific configuration.
However, as it is effectively just the combination of the `overview` and `index` commands, note that those two commands _do_ have their own configuration settings; see <<overview-configuration,overview configuration>> and <<index-configuration,index configuration>> respectively.

[#system-overview-overview]
=== System Overview (`overview`)

This command generates the _System Overview_ (`.adoc) page.

This page summarises the contents of each section (defined by the `global.sections` configuration key), also with a link:https://c4model.com/[C4] diagram showing how the modules relate.

As described <<configuration-file,above>>, sections are defined that either match on a group or on a group and artifact.
The overview command places these under a level 2 or a level 3 heading respectively.
By sequencing the sections correctly, this therefore allows a hierarchy to be created.

For example,

[source,yml]
.isis-tooling.yml
----
global:
  ...
  sections:
    ...
    Persistence: org.apache.isis.persistence
    JDO: "org.apache.isis.persistence:isis-persistence-jdo.*"
    JPA: "org.apache.isis.persistence:isis-persistence-jpa.*"
    ...
----

The `overview` command will render "Persistence" section at level 2 (because its pattern is only for a `groupId`), and then the "JDO" and "JPA" sections underneath at level 3 (because there patterns also include an `artifactId`).

This way, sections can be defined that create a hierarchy.


==== Usage

The `overview` command is usually invoked as follows:

[source]
----
java -jar tooling/cli/target/isis-tooling-cli.jar \
    -p . \
    -o antora/components/system/modules/generated \
    overview
----

where :

* `-p` and `-o` are the global options for all commands

* `overview` selects this sub-command

There are no command-specific options.



[[overview-configuration]]
==== Configuration

The `overview` command supports a number of command-specific configuration options:

[source,yml]
.isis-tooling.yml
----
commands:
  overview:
    description: "These tables summarize all Maven artifacts ..."           # <.>
    systemOverviewFilename: "system-overview.adoc"                          # <.>
----
<.> _System Overview_ head line
<.> name of the _System Overview_ (adoc) file



=== Index (`index`)

This command generates the _Document Global Index_ (`.adoc`) files.

Any class found with magic `{@index}` in its _java-doc_ section at type level, will be included with the _Document Global Index_.

Asciidoc files may refer to the _Document Global Index_ via `xref` or `include` statements using paths such as `refguide:applib:index/annotation/Xxx.adoc`.


==== Usage

The `index` command is usually invoked as follows:

[source]
----
java -jar tooling/cli/target/isis-tooling-cli.jar \
    -p . \
    -o antora/components/system/modules/generated \
    index
----

where :

* `-p` and `-o` are the global options for all commands

* `index` selects this sub-command

There are no command-specific options.


[[index-configuration]]
==== Configuration

The `index` command supports a number of command-specific configuration options:

[source,yml]
.isis-tooling.yml
----
commands:
  index:
    documentGlobalIndexPath: "pages/index"                                  # <.>
    documentGlobalIndexXrefPageIdFormat: "system:generated:index/%s.adoc"   # <.>
    fixOrphanedAdocIncludeStatements: true                                  # <.>
----
<.> sub-folder name for the _Document Global Index_
<.> format for include statements via which other _adoc_ files may refer to the Document Global Index
<.> whether to activate the `OrphanedIncludeStatementFixer`, discussed below.

The CLI also has an experimental `OrphanedIncludeStatementFixer` that checks orphaned index references in all _adoc_ files and tries to fix them.


==== Limitations

There are currently a couple of limitations:

* the _Document Global Index_ can only contain classes unique by their simple name, otherwise the `OrphanedIncludeStatementFixer` would not be able to reason about how to fix orphaned references.

* the `OrphanedIncludeStatementFixer` also can fix up references to classes that have been moved, but it cannot fix up orphans where the class has been renamed.
