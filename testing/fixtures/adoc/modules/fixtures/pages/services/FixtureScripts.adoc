The `FixtureScripts` service provides the ability to execute xref:fixtures:ROOT:about.adoc#api-and-usage[fixture scripts].

The default implementation of this service, `FixtureScriptsDefault`, uses the associated xref:testing:fixtures:services/FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider.adoc[FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider] to obtain a `FixtureScriptsSpecification`.
This configures this service, for example telling it which package to search for `FixtureScript` classes, how to execute those classes, and hints that influence the UI.
