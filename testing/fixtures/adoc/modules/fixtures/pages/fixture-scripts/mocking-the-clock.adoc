WARNING: TODO: v2 - this documentation has not yet been updated.
In particular, the `Clock` singleton has been removed, the `ClockService` has been refactored.

It's often useful to be able to change the effective time that a test runs.
The framework itself uses the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/clock/ClockService.adoc[ClockService] to obtain the current time, and applications should also use this domain service for a consistent view of the current time.

This page describes how to change the current time, and how to set up tests using fixture scripts with a mocked time.

== FixtureClock

The default xref:refguide:applib:index/services/clock/ClockService.adoc[ClockService] implementation in fact simply delegates to another class defined in the API, namely the `o.a.i.applib.clock.Clock`, an abstract singleton class.
It is not recommended that your code use the `Clock` directly, but it's worth understanding how this all works.

* If running in xref:refguide:config:about.adoc#deployment-types[production] (server) mode, then the framework will (lazily) instantiate the ``SystemClock` when first required.
This is a read-only clock that reads from the system time.
The instance registers itself as the singleton and cannot be replaced.

* If running in xref:refguide:config:about.adoc#deployment-types[prototype] mode, though, then the framework (using `FixturesLifecycleService`) will instead instantiate `FixtureClock`.
This is a read-write clock that will behave as the system clock, unless it is explicitly set using eg, `FixtureClock#setDate(...)` or `FixtureClock#setTime(...)` etc.

Moreover, the `FixtureClock` singleton can be replaced with another implementation.
And, it is sometimes useful to replace it using `TickingFixtureClock`, a subclass that is very similar to `FixtureClock` (in that the time can be changed) but which will continue to tick once set.


== TickingClockFixture

The `TickingClockFixture` is a pre-built fixture script that resets the date/time returned by the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/clock/ClockService.adoc[ClockService] to a known value.

Thereafter the time returned continues to tick forward (as would the real clock) until reset once more.

For example, to set the clock to return "3 Sept 2014", use:

[source,java]
----
executionContext.executeChild(this, new TickingClockFixture().setTo("2014-09-03"));
----

A variety of format strings are supported; the format "YYYY-MM-DD" (as shown above) will work in every locale.

NOTE: This fixture script requires that a `TickingFixtureClock` is initialized during bootstrapping.
