Apache Isis provides a library of link:https://www.archunit.org/[ArchUnit] tests to verify the structure of your domain applications.



== Setup


TODO: explain using similar format to elsewhere.

=== Maven Configuration

CAUTION: TODO

=== Recommended Naming Convention

Architecture tests run quickly, so it generally makes sense to name them as xref:testing:unittestsupport:about.adoc[unit tests] (with a `Test` suffix, to be picked up by surefire).

== Module Tests

CAUTION: TODO - to flesh out

[source,java]
.ModuleTests.java
----
@AnalyzeClasses(
        packagesOf = {
                CustomerModule.class                                                // <.>
                , OrderModule.class
                , ProductModule.class
        },
        importOptions = { ImportOption.DoNotIncludeTests.class }
)
public class ModuleTests {

    @ArchTest
    public static ArchRule code_dependencies_follow_module_Imports =
        ArchitectureModuleRules.code_dependencies_follow_module_Imports(            // <.>
            ArchitectureModuleRules.analyzeClasses_packagesOf(ModuleTests.class));  // <.>
}

<.> just obtains the list of modules


== Module Package Tests

CAUTION: TODO - to flesh out

Defines the rules for which subpackages or a module to check and whether the classes in those subpackages can access the classes in other subpackages either for the same module, or for modules that are referenced (`Import`ed) directly or transitively.


[source,java]
.Subpackage
----
public interface Subpackage {

    String getName();                                               // <.>
    List<String> mayBeAccessedBySubpackagesInSameModule();          // <.>
    List<String> mayBeAccessedBySubpackagesInReferencingModules();  // <.>
}
----

<.> The name of the subpackage, for example &quot;dom&quot;, &quot;api&quot, &quot;spi&quot; or &quot;fixtures&quot;.

<.> A list of the (names of the) subpackages where classes in the same module as this package have access.
+
For example, the &quot;dom&quot; subpackage can probably be referenced from the &quot;menu&quot; subpackage, but not vice versa.
+
The special value of &quot;*&quot; is a wildcard meaning that all subpackages (in the same module) can access.

<.> A list of the (names of the) subpackages where classes in the packages of other referencing modules may have access.
+
For example, in some cases the the &quot;dom&quot; subpackage may <i>not</i> be accessible from other modules if the intention is to require all programmatic access through an &quot;api&quot; subpackage (where the classes in `dom` implement interfaces defined in `api`).
+
The special value of &quot;*&quot; is a wildcard meaning that all subpackages (in other modules) can access.


The `SubpackageEnum` provides an off the shelf implementation.
