This module provides a mail-merge capability of input data into an MS Word `.docx` templates.
The generated output document is either Word `.docx` or Acrobat `.pdf`.
(Be aware that exporting to PDF requires more memory).

The module consists of a single domain service, `DocxService`.
This provides an API to merge a `.docx` template against its input data. The input data is represented as a simple HTML file.


The service supports several data types:

* plain text
* rich text
* date
* bulleted list
* tables

The implementation uses link:http://www.docx4java.org[docx4j] and link:http://www.jdom.org[jdom2].
Databinding to custom XML parts (the `.docx` file format's in-built support) is *not* used (as repeating datasets - required for lists and tables - was not supported prior to Word 2013).

In addition, add a section for the BOM of all subdomains:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.isis.subdomains</groupId>
            <artifactId>isis-subdomains</artifactId>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>

== Dependencies

In the domain module(s) of your application, add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.subdomains</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-subdomains-docx-applib</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

To output to PDF, the following dependency must also be added:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.docx4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>docx4j-export-fo</artifactId>
</dependency>
----


== Usage

The `.docx` templates use Word custom content controls as placeholders.
The actions to work with these placeholders can be enabled by toggling on the "Developer" menu:

image::word-enable-developer-ribbon.png[width=400px]

You can then toggle on _Design Mode_ to create/edit/remove custom content controls.

[[template-docx]]
For example, see link:{attachmentsdir}/Template.docx[Template.docx].

image::template-docx.png[width=600px]

To programmatically mail-merge into the template, we create a HTML document that provides the input.
For example:

[[input-html]]
[source,xhtml]
.input HTML
----
include::example$input-exact-match.html[]
----

We also parse the template into an internal data structure.
This is usually done during bootstrapping as it is almost certainly immutable, and the parsing can take a second or two:

[source,java]
----
WordprocessingMLPackage docxTemplate =
    docxService.loadPackage(io.openInputStream("Template.docx"));
----

We then merge in the input to the template as follows:

[source,java]
----
val baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
val params = DocxService.MergeParams.builder()
        .docxTemplateAsWpMlPackage(docxTemplate)            // <.>
        .inputAsHtml(inputHtml)                             // <.>
        .matchingPolicy(DocxService.MatchingPolicy.STRICT)
        .outputType(DocxService.OutputType.DOCX)
        .output(baos)
        .build();
docxService.merge(params);

final byte[] docxActual = baos.toByteArray();
----

<.> docx template, as shown <<template-docx,above>>
<.> input HTML, as shown <<input-html,above>>
