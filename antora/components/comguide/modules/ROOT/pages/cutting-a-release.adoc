The release process consists of:

* the release manager cutting the release (documented below)
* Members of the Apache Isis PMC xref:comguide:ROOT:verifying-releases.adoc[verifying] and voting on the release
* the release manager performing post-release tasks, for either a xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc.adoc[successful] or an xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-unsuccessful[unsuccessful] vote.

Apache Isis itself is released in one go, everything is ultimately a child of `core-parent/pom.xml` (relative to the link:https://github.com/apache/isis[source code root]).
This section details the process for formally releasing this module.

The subsequent sections describe how other committers can xref:comguide:ROOT:verifying-releases.adoc.adoc[verify a release] and how the release manager can then perform xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release[post-release] activities and set up for the next development iteration.

If you've not performed a release before, then note that there are some configuration xref:comguide:ROOT:release-process-prereqs.adoc[prerequisites] that must be configured first.
In particular, you'll need signed public/private keys, and the ASF Nexus staging repo inlocal `~/.m2/settings.xml` file.

These release notes using bash command line tools.
They should work on Linux and MacOS; for Windows, use mSysGit.


== Preparation

=== Obtain Consensus

Before releasing the framework, ensure there is consensus on the xref:docs:support:mailing-list.adoc[dev mailing list] that this is the right time for a release.
The discussion should include confirming the version number to be used, and to confirm content.

These discussions should also confirm the version number of the module being released.
This should be in line with our xref:comguide:ROOT:policies/versioning-policy.adoc#semantic-versioning[semantic versioning policy].

Make sure you have a JIRA ticket open against which to perform all commits.
In most cases a JIRA ticket will have been created at the beginning of the previous release cycle.


=== Pull down code to release

Set the HEAD of your local git repo to the commit to be released.
This will usually be the tip of the origin's `master` branch:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only
----

Check that there are no snapshot dependencies:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
grep SNAPSHOT $(/bin/find . -name pom.xml | grep -v target  sort)
----

The only mention of `SNAPSHOT` should be in the `revision` property of the root `core-prent/pom.xml` file.

Finally, switch to the `core-parent` directory:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd core-parent
----

=== License headers

The Apache Release Audit Tool `RAT` (from the http://creadur.apache.org[Apache Creadur] project) checks for missing license header files.
The parent `pom.xml` of each releasable module specifies the RAT Maven plugin, with a number of custom exclusions.

To run the RAT tool, use:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.find unapproved/missing licenses
----
mvn org.apache.rat:apache-rat-plugin:check -D rat.numUnapprovedLicenses=100

for a in `/bin/find .. -name rat.txt -print`; do grep '!???' $a; done
for a in `/bin/find .. -name rat.txt -print`; do grep '!AL' $a; done
----

where `rat.numUnapprovedLicenses` property is set to a high figure, temporarily overriding the default value of 0.
This will allow the command to run over all submodules, rather than failing after the first one.
The command writes out a `target\rat.txt` for each submodule. missing license notes are indicated using the key `!???`.
The `for` command collates all the errors.

Investigate and fix any reported violations, typically by either:

* adding genuinely missing license headers from Java (or other) source files, or
* updating the `<excludes>` element for the `apache-rat-plugin` plugin to ignore test files, log files and any other non-source code files
* also look to remove any stale `<exclude>` entries

Once you've fixed all issues, confirm once more that `apache-rat-plugin` no longer reports any license violations, this time leaving the `rat.numUnapprovedLicenses` property to its default, 0:

[source,bash]
.verify no unapproved/missing licenses
----
mvn org.apache.rat:apache-rat-plugin:check -D rat.numUnapprovedLicenses=0

for a in `/bin/find .. -name rat.txt -print`; do grep '!???' $a; done
----

=== Missing License Check

Although Apache Isis has no dependencies on artifacts with incompatible licenses, the POMs for some of these dependencies (in the Maven central repo) do not necessarily contain the required license information.
Without appropriate additional configuration, this would result in the generated `DEPENDENCIES` file and generated Maven site indicating dependencies as having "unknown" licenses.

Fortunately, Maven allows the missing information to be provided by configuring the `maven-remote-resources-plugin`.
This is stored in the `src/main/appended-resources/supplemental-models.xml` file, relative to the root of each releasable module.

It's first necessary to have built the framework locally at least once:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn clean install -o
----

Once this is done, capture the missing license information using:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn license:download-licenses
groovy ../scripts/checkmissinglicenses.groovy
----

WARNING: this groovy script assumes it is being run from the `core-parent` directory.

The Maven plugin creates a `license.xml` file in the `target/generated-resources` directory of each module.
The script then searches for these `licenses.xml` files, and compares them against the contents of the `supplemental-models.xml` file.

For example, the output could be something like:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
licenses to add to supplemental-models.xml:

[org.slf4j, slf4j-api, 1.5.7]
[org.codehaus.groovy, groovy-all, 1.7.2]

licenses to remove from supplemental-models.xml (are spurious):

[org.slf4j, slf4j-api, 1.5.2]
----

If any missing entries are listed or are spurious, then update `supplemental-models.xml` and try again.

=== Commit changes

Commit any changes from the preceding steps:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add ..
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: updates to pom.xml etc for release"
----


== Releasing the Framework

=== Set environment variables

We use environment variables to parameterize as many of the steps as possible.
For example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export ISISJIRA=ISIS-9999                           # <.>
export ISISTMP=/c/tmp                               # <.>
export ISISREL={page-isisrel}                             # <.>
export ISISRC=RC1                                   # <.>
export ISISBRANCH=release-$ISISREL-$ISISRC
export ISISART=isis
env | grep ISIS | sort
----
<.> set to an "umbrella" ticket for all release activities.
(One should exist already, xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc#create-new-jira[created at] the beginning of the development cycle now completing).
<.> adjust by platform
<.> adjust as required
<.> adjust as necessary if this is not the first attempt to release


[IMPORTANT]
====
The branch name is intentionally *not* the same as the eventual tag names (eg `isis-{page-isisrel}`).
====


=== Create a release branch and worktree

The release is performed on a branch; if we are successful, this branch will be merged back into master.

We also recommend performing this work in a separate git worktree.
The original worktree can stay with the `master` branch and be used for documentation fixes, etc.

* create (but don't checkout) a release branch for the version number being released; eg:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git branch $ISISBRANCH
----

* Create a worktree for this branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git worktree add ../isis-release $ISISBRANCH
----

* Switch to the `core-parent` directory in the new worktree:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis-release
cd core-parent
----

=== Bump `revision` property to `$ISISREL`

We use `mvn versions:set` to manually bump the release version:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL
mvn install -o -DskipTests

pushd ../starters
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL
popd

git add ..
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: bumps version to $ISISREL"
----

so that they should read:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<properties>
    <revision>{page-isisrel}</revision>
    ...
</properties>
----

NOTE: After release, there is a xref:comguide:ROOT:cutting-a-release.adoc#reset-revision-property[similar step at the end] to reset back to `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.


=== Sanity check

Perform one last sanity check on the codebase.
Delete all Isis artifacts from your local Maven repo, then build using the `-o` offline flag:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/isis
mvn clean install -o
----

=== Deploy

Since the `<version>` has already been updated, we just use `mvn deploy` to upload the artifacts.
We activate the (inherited) `apache-release` profile to bring in the `gpg` plugin for code signing.

The build creates a zip of the directory, so before executing the release we remove any other files.
Still in the `core-parent` directory:

[source,bash]
----
pushd ..
git clean -dfx
popd
----

To deploy (upload the artifacts), we use:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn deploy \
    -Dapache-release \
    -Dgit
----

When prompted, enter your GPG passphrase.
(Or, it might be sufficient to add just `-Dgpg.passphrase="..."`)

IMPORTANT: This requires `gpg` v2.1 or later.


=== Tag the Release

Finally, tag the release:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git tag $ISISART-$ISISREL
git tag $ISISART-$ISISREL-$ISISRC
----


=== Check/Close Staging Repo

The `mvn deploy` commands will have uploaded all of the release artifacts into a newly created staging repository on the ASF Nexus repository server.

Log onto http://repository.apache.org[repository.apache.org] (using your ASF LDAP account):

image::release-process/nexus-staging-0.png[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process/nexus-staging-0.png"]

And then check that the release has been staged (select `staging repositories` from left-hand side):

image::release-process/nexus-staging-1.png[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process/nexus-staging-1.png"]

If nothing appears in a staging repo you should stop here and work out why.

Assuming that the repo has been populated, make a note of its repo id; this is needed for the voting thread.
In the screenshot above the id is `org.apache.isis-008`.

After checking that the staging repository contains the artifacts that you expect you should close the staging repository.
This will make it available so that people can check the release.

Press the Close button and complete the dialog:

image::release-process/nexus-staging-2.png[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process/nexus-staging-2.png"]

Nexus should start the process of closing the repository.

image::release-process/nexus-staging-2a.png[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process/nexus-staging-2a.png"]

All being well, the close should (eventually) complete successfully (keep hitting refresh):

image::release-process/nexus-staging-3.png[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process/nexus-staging-3.png"]

The Nexus repository manager will also email you with confirmation of a successful close.

If Nexus has problems with the key signature, however, then the close will be aborted:

image::release-process/nexus-staging-4.png[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process/nexus-staging-4.png"]

Use `gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys nnnnnnnn` to confirm that the key is available.

[NOTE]
====
Unfortunately, Nexus does not seem to allow subkeys to be used for signing.
See xref:comguide:ROOT:key-generation.adoc[Key Generation] for more details.
====

=== Reset `revision` property

At the beginning of the release process we bumped the version to the release version, ie `$ISISREL`.
With the release now deployed we now need to reset the revision back down to the base snapshot, ie `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

[NOTE]
====
Previously we bumped to the next development snapshot.
However, this approach doesn't play well with CI/CD when Apache Isis is mounted as a git submodule, so instead we always use `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT` for all development work.
====

Therefore (still in the `core-parent` directory):

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
mvn install -DskipTests -o

pushd ../starters
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
popd

git add ..
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: resetting version"
----

=== Push branch & tag

Push the release branch to origin:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git push -u origin $ISISBRANCH
----

and also push tag:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git push origin refs/tags/isis-$ISISREL:refs/tags/isis-$ISISREL-$ISISRC
git fetch
----

[NOTE]
====
The remote tags aren't visible locally but can be seen link:https://github.com/apache/isis/tags[online].
====

== Update starter apps

For each starter app, we create a new branch and make the changes there, pushing the branch back if the sanity check passes.


* for helloworld, the steps are:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only

git checkout -b $ISISBRANCH

mvn versions:update-parent -DparentVersion=$ISISREL # <.>
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL

mvn clean install -o
mvn spring-boot:run
----
<.> requires the current parent to exist locally in `~/.m2/repository`.
If this isn't the case, then manually edit instead.

* for simple app, the steps are almost the same:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only

git checkout -b $ISISBRANCH

mvn versions:update-parent -DparentVersion=$ISISREL # <.>
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL

mvn clean install -o -Dmetamodel.lockdown
mvn -pl webapp test -o -Dmavendeps.lockdown
----
<.> requires the current parent to exist locally in `~/.m2/repository`.
If this isn't the case, then manually edit instead.
+
Approve any failed lockdown tests (the mavendeps will fail first time around because the dependencies on Apache Isis itself have just be bumped).
+
Repeat, then run the app as a sanity check:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn -pl webapp spring-boot:run
----

* For both apps, commit any changes and then push the release branch to origin once ok:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA - updates to $ISISREL"
git push -u origin $ISISBRANCH
----

== Preview website

We also prepare a preview of the next version of the website, then made accessible from link:https://isis.staged.apache.org[].

* Prerequisites:

** clone the link:https://github.com/apache/isis-site[] repo, alongside the `isis` repo:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone https://github.com/apache/isis-site ../isis-site
----

** in the `isis-site` repo, check out the `asf-staging` branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis-site

git checkout asf-staging
git pull --ff-only
----

* still in the `isis-site` repo, delete all the files in `content/` _except_ for the `schema` and `versions` directories:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
pushd content
for a in $(ls -1 | grep -v schema | grep -v versions)
do
    rm -rf $a
done
popd
----

* Back in the `isis` repo's worktree for `master` (as opposed to the `release` worktree, that is), generate the Antora site (from the top-level directory):
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis

sh preview.sh
----

* Copy the generated Antora site to `isis-site` repo's `contents` directory:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cp -Rf antora/target/site/* ../isis-site/content/.
----

* Back in the `isis-site` repo, commit the changes and preview:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis-site

git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA : staging changes to website"

sh preview.sh
----

* If happy, then push the changes:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git push origin asf-staging -u
----

Wait a minute or two; the site should be available at link:https://isis.staged.apache.org[]  (nb: 'staged', not 'staging').



== Voting

Once the artifacts have been uploaded, you can call a vote.

In all cases, votes last for 72 hours and require a +3 (binding) vote from members.


=== Start voting thread on dev mailing list

That is, link:mailto:dev@apache.isis.org[]

The following boilerplate is for a release of the Apache Isis Core.
Adapt as required:

Use the following subject, eg:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
[VOTE] Apache Isis Core release {page-isisrel} RC1
----

And use the following body:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
I've just cut a new release of the Apache Isis Framework.

The source code zip artifact has been uploaded to a staging repository on
https://repository.apache.org, along with its corresponding .asc signature.

In the source code repo the code has been tagged as isis-{page-isisrel}-RC1;
see https://github.com/apache/isis/tags

To verify the source code itself, you can use the following commands
(in an empty directory):

----------------------------------------------------------------
include::partial$verify-process.adoc[]
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can then test the helloworld or simpleapp starter apps, see:
https://isis.staged.apache.org/comguide/latest/verifying-releases.html.

You can also inspect the website in general, available at:
https://isis.staged.apache.org.

Please verify the release and cast your vote.
The vote will be open for a minimum of 72 hours.

[ ] +1
[ ]  0
[ ] -1
----

Remember to update:

* the version number (`{page-isisrel}` or whatever)
* the release candidate number (`RC1` or whatever)
* the `NEXUSREPONUM` to the repository id as provided by Nexus earlier (`11xx` or whatever)

Note that the email also references the procedure for other committers to xref:comguide:ROOT:verifying-releases.adoc[verify the release].
