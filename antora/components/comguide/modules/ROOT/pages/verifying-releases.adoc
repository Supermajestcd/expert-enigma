The release process consists of:

* the release manager xref:comguide:ROOT:cutting-a-release.adoc[cutting the release]
* members of the Apache Isis PMC verifying and voting on the release (documented below)
* the release manager performing post-release tasks, for either a xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc.adoc[successful] or an xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-unsuccessful[unsuccessful] vote.

This section describes some guidance on what a voter (members of the Apache Isis PMC and anyone else who wishes) is expected to xref:comguide:ROOT:release-process.adocdo before casting their vote in order to verify a release.

== Background

Whenever a release manager announces a vote on a release (as per the [release process]) on the xref:docs:support:mailing-list.adoc#mailing-lists[dev mailing list], it is the responsibility of the project's PMC to cast their vote on the release.
Anyone else can also vote, but only members of the Apache Isis PMC's vote are binding.

Per this http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html[ASF documentation], the legal requirements for an ASF release are:

* a source zip file + corresponding signature (signed by the release manager, which is in the ASF web of trust and in our KEYS file)
* all source files have the Apache license (this is ensured by the running of the rat plugin prior to release; you could run it on the unzipped source)
* all dependencies are appropriately licensed; see the `DEPENDENCIES` file which is automatically generated from the POMs plus the supplemental-models.xml file

Note that the binaries are _not_ an ASF release, they merely exist on the Maven central repo as a convenience.
That said, you might also want to verify the release by pulling the binaries from the Maven staging repository.
Details of how to do this are also documented below.

== Prerequisites

You will also require the following commands/tools:

* `bash` - to run shell script
* `curl` or `wget` - to download the ZIP files
* `gpg` - to verify signatures
* `unzip` - to unzip the ZIP files
* JDK 8
* Apache Maven (`mvn`) 3.5.0+

== Verifying source artifacts

The easiest way to verify the source artifacts is to use a script that automates the steps.
Run these commands (they should also be listed in the VOTE email):

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
VERSION={isisnext}
NEXUSREPONUM=10xx                   # <1>

curl http://www.apache.org/dist/isis/KEYS > /tmp/KEYS
gpg --import /tmp/KEYS

rm -rf isis-$VERSION*

curl -O -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/isis/master/scripts/verify-isis-release.sh

chmod +x ./verify-isis-release.sh
./verify-isis-release.sh $NEXUSREPONUM $VERSION
----
<1> Adjust as per VOTE email.

Just copy and paste these commands to your terminal, and run.

The `verify-isis-release.sh` script:

* downloads artifacts (`.zip` files and `.asc` files from the staging repository hosted on the Apache (Nexus) repository server.
+
The location of this repository will be in the VOTE email.

* verifies that the signatures are correct
+
in other words, to confirm that the release was created by an Apache Isis committer

* builds the framework code from source

Assuming this completes successfully, you can then test the two starter applications; adjust the version if required.

You can if you wish perform some additional optional checks, listed in the sections below.
Alternatively, you can xref:comguide:ROOT:verifying-releases.adoc#casting-a-vote[cast your vote].

== (Optional) Verifying binary artifacts

You can verify the binary releases by configuring your local Maven install to point to the Maven staging repository (or repositories) and then using them, eg to run the xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld starter app] or the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp starter app] (adjust the parent version if required).

Configuring your local Maven install amounts to updating the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>verify-isis</id>
        <repositories>
            <repository>
                <id>isis-core-staging</id>
                <name>Isis Core Staging</name>
                <releases>
                    <enabled>true</enabled>
                    <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
                    <checksumPolicy>warn</checksumPolicy>
                </releases>
                <url>http://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheisis-10xx</url>
                <layout>default</layout>
            </repository>
            ...
        </repositories>
    </profile>
    ...
</profiles>
<activeProfiles>
    <activeProfile>verify-isis</activeProfile>
    ...
</activeProfiles>
----

where the repository URL is as provided in the VOTE email.
If there is more than one repository (as is sometimes the case if multiple components have been released), then repeat the `<repository>` section for each.

Once the vote has completed, the staging repositories will be removed and so you should deactive the profile (comment out the `<activeProfile>` element).
If you forget to deactive the profile, there should be no adverse effects; Maven will just spend unnecessary cycles attempting to hit a non-existent repo.


== (Optional) Creadur Tools

The http://creadur.apache.org[Apache Creadur] project exists to provide a set of tools to ensure compliance with Apache's licensing standards.

The main release auditing tool, http://creadur.apache.org/rat[Apache RAT] is used in the xref:comguide:ROOT:cutting-a-release.adoc[release process].

Creadur's remaining tools - link:http://creadur.apache.org/tentacles/[Tentacles] and link:http://creadur.apache.org/whisker/[Whisker] - are to support the verification process.

For example, Tentacles generates a report called `archives.html`.
This lists all of the top-level binaires, their `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files and any `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files of any binaries they may contain.

Validation of the output at this point is all still manual.
Things to check include:

* any binaries that contain no LICENSE and NOTICE files
* any binaries that contain more than one LICENSE or NOTICE file

In this report, each binary will have three links listed after its name '(licenses, notices, contents)'

== Casting a Vote

When you have made the above checks (and any other checks you think may be relevant), cast your vote by replying to the email thread on the mailing list.

If you are casting `-1`, please provide details of the problem(s) you have found.
