Configures the Restful Objects viewer to emit custom representations (rather than the standard representations defined in the RO spec).

The default implementations ultimately generate representations according to theRestful Objects specv1.0. It does this through a level of abstraction by delegating to implementations of the xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/rendering/service/conneg/ContentNegotiationService.adoc[ContentNegotiationService] SPI. This provides a mechanism for altering representations according to the HTTP `Accept` header.

This interface is EXPERIMENTAL and may change in the future.

== Members

[#objectRepresentation__IResourceContext_ManagedObject]
=== objectRepresentation(IResourceContext, ManagedObject)

Returns a representation of a single object.

By default this representation is as per section 14.4 of the RO spec, v1.0.

[#propertyDetails__IResourceContext_ManagedProperty]
=== propertyDetails(IResourceContext, ManagedProperty)

Returns a representation of a single property of an object.

By default this representation is as per section 16.4 of the RO spec, v1.0.

[#collectionDetails__IResourceContext_ManagedCollection]
=== collectionDetails(IResourceContext, ManagedCollection)

Returns a representation of a single collection of an object.

By default this representation is as per section 17.5 of the RO spec, v1.0.

[#actionPrompt__IResourceContext_ManagedAction]
=== actionPrompt(IResourceContext, ManagedAction)

Returns a representation of a single action (prompt) of an object.

By default this representation is as per section 18.2 of the RO spec, v1.0.

[#actionResult__IResourceContext_ObjectAndActionInvocation]
=== actionResult(IResourceContext, ObjectAndActionInvocation)

Returns a representation of a single action invocation of an object.

By default this representation is as per section 19.5 of the RO spec, v1.0.

[#buildResponse__Function]
=== buildResponse(Function)

Iterates over all _#contentNegotiationServices injected_ xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/rendering/service/conneg/ContentNegotiationService.adoc[ContentNegotiationService] s to find one that returns a _Response.ResponseBuilder_ using the provided function.

There will always be at least one such service, namely the xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/rendering/service/conneg/ContentNegotiationServiceForRestfulObjectsV1_0.adoc[ContentNegotiationServiceForRestfulObjectsV1_0] .
