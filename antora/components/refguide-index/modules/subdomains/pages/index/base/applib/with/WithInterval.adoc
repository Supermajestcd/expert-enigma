[#getStartDate__]
=== getStartDate()

The start date of the interval.

A value of `null` implies that the parent's start date should be used. If that is `null` , then implies 'the beginning of time'.

[#getEndDate__]
=== getEndDate()

The end date of the interval.

A value of `null` implies that the parent's end date should be used. If that is `null` , then implies 'the end of time'.
