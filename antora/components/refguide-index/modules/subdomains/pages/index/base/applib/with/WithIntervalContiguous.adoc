[#getPredecessor__]
=== getPredecessor()

The interval that immediately precedes this one, if any.

The predecessor's _#getEndDate() end date_ is the day before this interval's _#getStartDate() start date_ .

Implementations where successive intervals are NOT contiguous should instead implement xref:refguide:subdomains:index/base/applib/Chained.adoc[Chained] .

[#getSuccessor__]
=== getSuccessor()

The interval that immediately succeeds this one, if any.

The successor's _#getStartDate() start date_ is the day after this interval's _#getEndDate() end date_ .

Implementations where successive intervals are NOT contiguous should instead implement xref:refguide:subdomains:index/base/applib/Chained.adoc[Chained] .

[#getTimeline__]
=== getTimeline()

Show this xref:refguide:subdomains:index/base/applib/with/WithIntervalContiguous.adoc[WithIntervalContiguous] in context with its predecessors and successors.

This will typically (always) be a derived collection obtained by filtering a collection of the "parent".
