[#getPrevious__]
=== getPrevious()

The object (usually an xref:refguide:subdomains:index/base/applib/with/WithInterval.adoc[WithInterval] , but not necessarily) that precedes this one, if any (not necessarily contiguously)..

Implementations where successive intervals are contiguous should instead implement xref:refguide:subdomains:index/base/applib/with/WithIntervalContiguous.adoc[WithIntervalContiguous] .

[#getNext__]
=== getNext()

The object (usually an xref:refguide:subdomains:index/base/applib/with/WithInterval.adoc[WithInterval] , but not necessarily) that succeeds this one, if any (not necessarily contiguously).

Implementations where successive intervals are contiguous should instead implement xref:refguide:subdomains:index/base/applib/with/WithIntervalContiguous.adoc[WithIntervalContiguous] .
