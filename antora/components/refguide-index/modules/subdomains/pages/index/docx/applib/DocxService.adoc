[#loadPackage__InputStream]
=== loadPackage(InputStream)

Load and return an in-memory representation of a docx.

This is public API because building the in-memory structure can be quite slow. Thus, clients can use this method to cache the in-memory structure, and pass it in the _MergeParams_ (through the _MergeParams.Builder#docxTemplateAsWpMlPackage(WordprocessingMLPackage) builder method_ )

[#merge__MergeParams]
=== merge(MergeParams)

Merge the input arguments (as HTML) against the Docx template, writing out as a Word docx..
