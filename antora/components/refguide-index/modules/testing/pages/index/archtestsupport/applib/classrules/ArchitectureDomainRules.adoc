A library of architecture tests to ensure coding conventions are followed for domain classes, for example as annotated with xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc[DomainObject] or xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainService.adoc[DomainService] but also more generally, for example repositories that are not necessarily part of the framework's metamodel.

In addition, there should be a method to be invoked for the method (typically "act", but checked against _DomainObject#mixinMethod() @DomainObject#mixinMethod_ if overridden.

The rationale is so that the pattern is easy to spot and to search for, with common programming model errors detected during unit testing rather tha relying on integration testing.

[#every_injected_field_of_jaxb_view_model_must_be_annotated_with_XmlTransient__]
=== every_injected_field_of_jaxb_view_model_must_be_annotated_with_XmlTransient()

This rule requires that injected fields in jaxb view models (that is, classes annotated with the JAXB _javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement_ annotation) must also be annotated with JAXB _javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlTransient_ annotation.

The rationale here is that injected services are managed by the runtime and are not/cannot be serialized to XML.

[#every_injected_field_of_serializable_view_model_must_be_transient__]
=== every_injected_field_of_serializable_view_model_must_be_transient()

This rule requires that injected fields in jaxb view models (that is, classes annotated with the JAXB _javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement_ annotation) must also be annotated with JAXB _javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlTransient_ annotation.

The rationale here is that injected services are managed by the runtime and are not/cannot be serialized to XML.

[#every_finder_method_in_Repository_must_return_either_Collection_or_Optional__]
=== every_finder_method_in_Repository_must_return_either_Collection_or_Optional()

This rule requires that finders of repos reutrn either _java.util.Collection_ s or _java.util.Optional_ s.

In particular, this excludes the option of returning a simple scalar, such as `Customer` ; they must return an `Optional<Customer>` instead. This forces the caller to handle the fact that the result might be empty (ie no result).

One exception is that methods named "findOrCreate", which are allowed to return an instance rather than an optional.
