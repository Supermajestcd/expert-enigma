Provides a mechanism to get (and possible to set) the current time.

The clock is used primarily by the temporal value classes, and is accessed by the framework as a singleton. The actual implementation used can be configured at startup, but once specified the clock instance cannot be changed.

Unless another xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/clock/clock/Clock.adoc[Clock] implementation has been installed, the first call to _#getInstance()_ will instantiate an implementation that just uses the system's own clock. Alternate implementations can be created via suitable subclasses, but this must be done * _before_ * the first call to _#getInstance()_ .

== Members

[#getInstance__]
=== getInstance()

Returns the (singleton) instance of xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/clock/clock/Clock.adoc[Clock] .

Unless it has been otherwise created, will lazily instantiate an implementation that just delegate to the computer's own system clock (as per _System#currentTimeMillis()_ .

[#isInitialized__]
=== isInitialized()

Whether has been initialized or not.

[#getEpochMillis__]
=== getEpochMillis()

The time as the number of milliseconds since the epoch start. (UTC)

[#getTimeAsOffsetDateTime__]
=== getTimeAsOffsetDateTime()

Returns the time as _OffsetDateTime_ , using the _ZoneId#systemDefault() system default_ timezone.

[#getTimeAsJodaDateTime__]
=== getTimeAsJodaDateTime()

Returns the time as a Joda _DateTime_ , using the _ZoneId#systemDefault() system default_ timezone.
