== Members

[#replaceExisting__]
=== replaceExisting()

Configures the system to use a FixtureClock rather than the in-built system clock. Can be called multiple times.

Must call before any other call to _Clock#getInstance()_ .

[#reinstateExisting__]
=== reinstateExisting()

Makes _Clock#remove()_ visible.

[#setTime__int_int]
=== setTime(int, int)

Sets the hours and minutes as specified, and sets the seconds and milliseconds to zero, but the date portion is left unchanged.

[#setDate__int_int_int]
=== setDate(int, int, int)

Sets the date, but the time portion is left unchanged.

[#addTime__int_int]
=== addTime(int, int)

Adjusts the time by the specified number of hours and minutes.

Typically called after _#setTime(int, int)_ , to move the clock forward or perhaps back.

[#addDate__int_int_int]
=== addDate(int, int, int)

Adjusts the time by the specified number of years, months or days.

Typically called after _#setDate(int, int, int)_ , to move the clock forward or perhaps back.
