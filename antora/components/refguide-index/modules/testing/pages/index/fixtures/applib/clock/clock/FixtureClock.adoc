This clock, for use by fixtures, can be set to specific time.

If not set it will provide the time provided by the system clock.

Note that - by design - it does not provide any mechanism to advance the time (eg automatic ticking of the clock). That is, the time returned is always explicitly under the control of the programmer (it can be moved forward or back as required).

== Members

[#initialize__]
=== initialize()

Configures the system to use a FixtureClock rather than the in-built system clock. Can be called multiple times.

Must call before any other call to _Clock#getInstance()_ .

[#remove__]
=== remove()

Makes _Clock#remove()_ visible.

[#clear__]
=== clear()

Sets the clock to epoch, that is midnight, 1 Jan 1970 UTC.

This is typically called before either _#setDate(int, int, int)_ (so that time is set to midnight) and/or _#setTime(int, int)_ (so that date is set to a well known value).

[#setTime__int_int]
=== setTime(int, int)

Sets the hours and minutes as specified, and sets the seconds and milliseconds to zero, but the date portion is left unchanged.

[#setDate__int_int_int]
=== setDate(int, int, int)

Sets the date, but the time portion is left unchanged.

[#addTime__int_int]
=== addTime(int, int)

Adjusts the time by the specified number of hours and minutes.

Typically called after _#setTime(int, int)_ , to move the clock forward or perhaps back.

[#addDate__int_int_int]
=== addDate(int, int, int)

Adjusts the time by the specified number of years, months or days.

Typically called after _#setDate(int, int, int)_ , to move the clock forward or perhaps back.

[#reset__]
=== reset()

Go back to just returning the system's time.
