Fired whenever the framework interacts with a domain object's action.

This is the specialization of xref:refguide:applib:index/events/domain/AbstractDomainEvent.adoc[AbstractDomainEvent] , for actions, which should then be further subclassed by domain application.

The class has a number of responsibilities (in addition to those it inherits):

* capture the arguments for each of the action's parameters
* provide selected metadata about the action parameters from the metamodel (names, types)

The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework using a no-arg constructor; fields are set reflectively.

This is useful where the domain event is declared in a mixin, which itself is nested as a non-static class within a parent type.
In such a case the Java compiler implicitly adds a one-arg constructor of the parent type to the mixin, which means that the mixin contributes to its parent.
The domain event defined within the mixin must also be non-static, and the compiler will again implicit add a one-arg constructor taking the mixin instance as its source.

[#setReturnValue__Object]
=== setReturnValue(Object)

Set by the framework.

Event subscribers can replace the value with some other value if they wish, though only in the _AbstractDomainEvent.Phase#EXECUTED_ phase.
