Fired whenever the framework interacts with a domain object's collection.

This is the specialization of xref:refguide:applib:index/events/domain/AbstractDomainEvent.adoc[AbstractDomainEvent] , for collections, * which should then be further subclassed by domain application. .

The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework using a no-arg constructor; fields are set reflectively.

Subtypes can define a no-arg constructor; the framework sets state via (non-API) setters.

Subtypes can define a one-arg constructor; the framework sets state via (non-API) setters.
This is useful where the domain event is declared in a mixin, which itself is nested as a non-static class within a parent type.
In such a case the Java compiler implicitly adds a one-arg constructor of the parent type to the mixin, which means that the mixin contributes to its parent.
The domain event defined within the mixin must also be non-static, and the compiler will again implicit add a one-arg constructor taking the mixin instance as its source.
