Indicates that the class has value semantics.

By "value semantics" all we actually mean that the class is aggregated (or embedded) and so therefore (conceptually) is not shared between instances of classes. However, values very often have other semantics, and so this annotation allows these to also be specified:

* it may be parseable
* it may be encodeable
* it may be immutable, and by default is presumed that it is
* it may follow the equal-by-content contract (as per xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/EqualByContent.adoc[EqualByContent] ), and by default is presumed that it does.
+
--
Note also that though a value is conceptually not shared, if it is also immutable then it is in fact safe to share objects (as in the flyweight pattern). In addition, the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/EqualByContent.adoc[EqualByContent] semantic means that we needn't care whether value types are being shared or not.

[#semanticsProviderName]
=== semanticsProviderName

The fully qualified name of a class that implements the xref:refguide:applib:index/adapters/ValueSemanticsProvider.adoc[ValueSemanticsProvider] interface.

This is optional because some implementations may pick up encodeability via a configuration file, or via the equivalent _#semanticsProviderClass()_ .

It is possible for value classes to act as their own semantics providers, and may in particular implement the xref:refguide:applib:index/adapters/EncoderDecoder.adoc[EncoderDecoder] interface. The framework requires that the nominated class provides a `public` no-arg constructor on the class, and will instantiates an instance of the class to interact with it. In the case of encoding, the framework uses the result of discards the instantiated object. What that means in particular is that a self-encoding class shouldn't encode its own state, it should encode the state of the object passed to it.

Implementation note: the default value provided here is simply an empty string because `null` is not a valid default.

[#semanticsProviderClass]
=== semanticsProviderClass

As per _#semanticsProviderName()_ , but specifying a class literal rather than a fully qualified class name.

Implementation note: the default value provided here is simply the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Value.adoc[Value] 's own class, because `null` is not a valid default.
