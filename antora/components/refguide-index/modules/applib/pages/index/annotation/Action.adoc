== Members

[#associateWith]
=== associateWith

Associates this action with a property or collection, specifying its id.

To specify the layout order use _ActionLayout#sequence()_ .

For example `@Action(associateWith="items") @ActionLayout(sequence="2.1")` 

If an action is associated with a collection, then any matching parameters will have their choices automatically inferred from the collection (if not otherwise specified) and any collection parameter defaults can be specified using checkboxes (in the Wicket UI, at least).

[#commandDtoProcessor]
=== commandDtoProcessor

The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/commanddto/processor/CommandDtoProcessor.adoc[CommandDtoProcessor] to process this command's DTO.

The processor itself is used by xref:refguide:applib:index/services/commanddto/conmap/ContentMappingServiceForCommandDto.adoc[ContentMappingServiceForCommandDto] and xref:refguide:applib:index/services/commanddto/conmap/ContentMappingServiceForCommandsDto.adoc[ContentMappingServiceForCommandsDto] to dynamically transform the DTOs.

[#commandPublishing]
=== commandPublishing

Whether action invocations, captured as xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command] s, should be published to xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/CommandSubscriber.adoc[CommandSubscriber] s.

[#domainEvent]
=== domainEvent

Indicates that an invocation of the action should be posted to the _org.apache.isis.applib.services.eventbus.EventBusService_ using a custom (subclass of) xref:refguide:applib:index/events/domain/ActionDomainEvent.adoc[ActionDomainEvent] .

Subscribers of this event can interact with the business rule checking (hide, disable, validate) and its modification (before and after).

For example:

----

public class SomeObject{
    public static class ChangeStartDateDomainEvent extends ActionDomainEvent<SomeObject> { ... }

    @Action(domainEvent=ChangedStartDateDomainEvent.class)
    public void changeStartDate(final Date startDate) { ...}
    ...
}
----

This subclass must provide a no-arg constructor; the fields are set reflectively.

[#executionPublishing]
=== executionPublishing

Whether xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Execution.adoc[Execution] s (triggered by action invocations), should be published to xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[ExecutionSubscriber] s.

[#hidden]
=== hidden

Indicates where (in the UI) the action is not visible to the user.

It is also possible to suppress an action's visibility using _ActionLayout#hidden()_ .

For xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainService.adoc[DomainService] actions, the action's visibility is dependent upon its _DomainService#nature() nature_ .

[#restrictTo]
=== restrictTo

Whether the action is restricted to prototyping, or whether it is available also in production mode.

By default there are no restrictions, with the action being available in all environments.

[#semantics]
=== semantics

The action semantics, either _SemanticsOf#SAFE_AND_REQUEST_CACHEABLE cached_ , _SemanticsOf#SAFE safe_ (query-only), _SemanticsOf#IDEMPOTENT idempotent_ or _SemanticsOf#NON_IDEMPOTENT non-idempotent_ .

The action's semantics determine whether objects are modified as the result of invoking this action (if not, the results can be cached for the remainder of the request). If the objects do cause a change in state, they additionally determine whether re-invoking the action would result in a further change.

There are also `...ARE_YOU_SURE` variants (@link _SemanticsOf#IDEMPOTENT_ARE_YOU_SURE_ and (@link _SemanticsOf#NON_IDEMPOTENT_ARE_YOU_SURE_ that cause a confirmation dialog to be displayed in the Wicket viewer.

[#typeOf]
=== typeOf

If the action returns a collection, then this hints as to the run-time type of the objects within that collection.

This is only provided as a fallback; usually the framework can infer the element type of the collection from the action method's return type (eg if it returns `Collection` instead of `Collection<Customer>` )

[#fileAccept]
=== fileAccept

For downloading xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Blob.adoc[Blob] or xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Clob.adoc[Clob] , optionally restrict the files accepted (eg `.xslx` ).

The value should be of the form "file_extension|audio/*|video/*|image/*|media_type".
