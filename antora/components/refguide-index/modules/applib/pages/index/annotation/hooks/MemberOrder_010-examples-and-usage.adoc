// TODO: v2: ISIS-2545: replace @MemberOrder#name() with @PropertyLayout#group().

The interpretation of the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/MemberOrder.adoc#name[name()] element varies dependent on the type of object member it is annotated upon, but generally speaking it is used to associate members together.


The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/MemberOrder.adoc#sequence[sequence()] element then orders those members that have been grouped together.



=== Properties

For properties, the `name` attribute is used to group properties together, and `sequence` orders the properties within that group.
It corresponds to a `<fieldset>` if using xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[layout files].


For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @MemberOrder(name = "Personal Details", sequence = "1.0")
    private String firstName;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Personal Details", sequence = "2.0")
    private String lastName;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address", sequence = "1.0")
    private String addressLine1;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address", sequence = "2.0")
    private String addressLine2;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address", sequence = "3.0")
    private String city;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address", sequence = "4.0")
    private String zipCode;

    // ...
}
----

TIP: It's possible to combine `@MemberOrder` with xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[layout file].
Use the layout file to define the positioning of the fieldsets, and use `@MemberOrder` to organise the properties within the fieldset.

=== Actions

For actions, the `name` attribute indicates the name of a property to associate the action with, and `sequence` orders all the actions associated with the same property or collection (on the panel of the property's fieldset, or collection's title bar).


For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @MemberOrder(name = "Personal Details")
    public Customer updateName(String firstName, String lastName) {
        // ...
    }

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address")
    public Customer changeAddress(String firstName, String lastName) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
----

TIP: For actions, `@Member#name()` element and xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#associateWith[@Action#associateWith()] element have the same effect.

TIP: For actions associated with properties, the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/ActionLayout.adoc#position[@ActionLayout#position()] element indicates whether the action should be rendered beneath the property's field, or instead on the property's fieldset panel's header.


=== Collections

The `name` attribute is ignored when annotated on collections.
