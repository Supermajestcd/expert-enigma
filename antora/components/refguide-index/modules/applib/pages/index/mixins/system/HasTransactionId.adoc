Extends xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/system/HasInteractionId.adoc[HasInteractionId] to add a strictly monotonically increasing sequence number so that each transaction within the overall _org.apache.isis.applib.services.iactn.Interaction_ has its own unique identity.

In the vast majority of cases there will only be a single transaction per _org.apache.isis.applib.services.iactn.Interaction_ , but this isn't _always_ the case as domain objects may on occasion need to explicitly manage transaction boundaries using _org.apache.isis.applib.services.xactn.TransactionService_ .

[#getSequence__]
=== getSequence()

Holds the sequence number uniquely identifying the transaction number within the overall _org.apache.isis.applib.services.iactn.Interaction_ .

The values in this sequence are ultimately obtained from the non-API method _org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.execution.InteractionInternal#getTransactionSequence_ .
