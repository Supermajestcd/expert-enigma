== Members

[#viewModelMemento__]
=== viewModelMemento()

Obtain a memento of the view model.

Typically this will be the identifier of a backing domain entity, but it could also be an arbitrary string, for example a bunch of JSON.

This method is called by the framework in order that the view model may be recreated subsequently through _#viewModelInit(String)_ .

[#viewModelInit__String]
=== viewModelInit(String)

Used to re-initialize a view model with a memento obtained from _#viewModelMemento()_ .
