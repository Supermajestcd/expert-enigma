[#select__Class_Annotation[]]
=== select(Class, Annotation[])

Obtains a xref:refguide:commons:index/collections/Can.adoc[Can] container containing any matching instances for the given required type and additional required qualifiers.

[#select__Class]
=== select(Class)

Obtains a xref:refguide:commons:index/collections/Can.adoc[Can] container containing any matching instances for the given required type.

[#streamRegisteredBeansOfType__Class]
=== streamRegisteredBeansOfType(Class)

Streams all registered bean adapters implementing the requested type.

[#streamRegisteredBeans__]
=== streamRegisteredBeans()

Returns all bean adapters that have been registered.

[#lookupRegisteredBeanById__String]
=== lookupRegisteredBeanById(String)

Returns a registered bean of given _name_ .

[#lookupRegisteredBeanByIdElseFail__String]
=== lookupRegisteredBeanByIdElseFail(String)

Returns a registered bean of given _name_ , or throws when no such bean.

[#lookupService__Class]
=== lookupService(Class)

Returns a domain service implementing the requested type.

If this lookup is ambiguous, the service annotated with highest priority is returned. see _Priority_

[#lookupService__Class_Comparator]
=== lookupService(Class, Comparator)

Returns a domain service implementing the requested type.

If this lookup is ambiguous, then the provided comparator is used.

[#lookupServiceElseFail__Class]
=== lookupServiceElseFail(Class)

Looks up a domain service of the requested type (same as _#lookupService(Class)_ ) but throws a _NoSuchElementException_ if there are no such instances.
