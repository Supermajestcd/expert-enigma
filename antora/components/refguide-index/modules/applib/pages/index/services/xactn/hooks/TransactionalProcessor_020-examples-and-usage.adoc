== Example Usage

The following code is taken from the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp], showing how the service can be used to provide a custom REST controller:

[source,java]
----
@RestController
@RequiredArgsConstructor
class CustomController {

  private final InteractionFactory interactionFactory;
  private final TransactionalProcessor transactionalProcessor;  // <.>
  private final SimpleObjects repository;

  @GetMapping("/custom/simpleObjects")
  List<SimpleObject> all() {
    return callAuthenticated(newAuthentication(), repository::listAll).presentElseFail();
  }

  private SimpleAuthentication newAuthentication() {
    return SimpleAuthentication.validOf(UserMemento.ofName("sven"));
  }

  private <T> Result<T> callAuthenticated(
          final Authentication authentication,
          final Callable<T> task) {
    return interactionFactory.callAuthenticated(
            authentication,
            () -> transactionService.callWithinCurrentTransactionElseCreateNew(task));
  }
}
----
