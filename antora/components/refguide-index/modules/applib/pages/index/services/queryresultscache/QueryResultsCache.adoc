Provides a mechanism by which idempotent query results can be cached for the duration of an interaction.

Caching such values is useful to improve the response time (for the end user) of code that loops "naively" through a set of items, performing an expensive operation each time. If the data is such that the same expensive operation is made many times, then the query cache is a perfect fit.
