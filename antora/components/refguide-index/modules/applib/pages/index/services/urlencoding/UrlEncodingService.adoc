Defines a consistent way to convert strings to/from a form safe for use within a URL.

The service is used by the framework to map mementos (derived from the state of the view model itself) into a form that can be used as a view model. When the framework needs to recreate the view model (for example to invoke an action on it), this URL is converted back into a view model memento, from which the view model can be hydrated.
