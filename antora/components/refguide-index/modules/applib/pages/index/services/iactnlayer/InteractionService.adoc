A low-level service to programmatically "connect" (or create a session, or interact with; choose your term) the the framework's runtime.

This service is used internally by the framework itself, for example when a viewer receives a request a new xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] is created for the duration of the users's interaction. It is also used by integration tests, to be able to connect to the database.

You could think of this as analogous to an `HttpRequest` , or a JPA `EntityManager` or JDO `PersistenceManager` .

There are two main APIs exposed. One is to _#openInteraction(InteractionContext) open_ a new xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] , to be _#closeInteractionLayers() closed later_ . The other is to execute a _Callable_ or _ThrowingRunnable runnable_ within the duration of an xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] , wrapping up automatically. This is what is used by _org.apache.isis.applib.services.sudo.SudoService_ , for example.

== Members

[#openInteraction__]
=== openInteraction()

If present, reuses the current top level xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] , otherwise creates a new anonymous one.

[#openInteraction__InteractionContext]
=== openInteraction(InteractionContext)

Returns a new or reused xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] that is a holder of the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] on top of the current thread's interaction layer stack.

If available reuses an existing xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] , otherwise creates a new one.

The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] represents a user's span of activities interacting with the application. These can be stacked (usually temporarily), for example for a sudo session or to mock the clock. The stack is later closed using _#closeInteractionLayers()_ .

[#closeInteractionLayers__]
=== closeInteractionLayers()

closes all open xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] (s) as stacked on the current thread

[#isInInteraction__]
=== isInInteraction()

[#call__InteractionContext_Callable]
=== call(InteractionContext, Callable)

Executes a block of code with a new or reused xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] using a new or reused xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] .

If there is currently no xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] a new one is created.

If there is currently an xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionLayer.adoc[InteractionLayer] that has an equal xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] to the given one, it is reused, otherwise a new one is created.

[#run__InteractionContext_ThrowingRunnable]
=== run(InteractionContext, ThrowingRunnable)

Variant of _#call(InteractionContext, Callable)_ that takes a runnable.

[#callAnonymous__Callable]
=== callAnonymous(Callable)

As per _#call(InteractionContext, Callable)_ , but using an anonymous xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] .

[#runAnonymous__ThrowingRunnable]
=== runAnonymous(ThrowingRunnable)

As per _#callAnonymous(Callable)_ , but for a runnable.

[#callAndCatch__InteractionContext_Callable]
=== callAndCatch(InteractionContext, Callable)

Variant of _#call(InteractionContext, Callable)_ that wraps the return value with a xref:refguide:commons:index/functional/Result.adoc[Result] , also catching any exception, that might have occurred.

[#runAndCatch__InteractionContext_ThrowingRunnable]

Variant of _#run(InteractionContext, ThrowingRunnable)_ that returns a xref:refguide:commons:index/functional/Result.adoc[Result] of _Result_ , also catching any exception, that might have occurred.

[#callAnonymousAndCatch__Callable]
=== callAnonymousAndCatch(Callable)

Variant of _#callAnonymous(Callable)_ that wraps the return value with a xref:refguide:commons:index/functional/Result.adoc[Result] , also catching any exception, that might have occurred.

[#runAnonymousAndCatch__ThrowingRunnable]
=== runAnonymousAndCatch(ThrowingRunnable)

Variant of _#runAnonymous(ThrowingRunnable)_ that returns a xref:refguide:commons:index/functional/Result.adoc[Result] of _Result_ , also catching any exception, that might have occurred.
