Allows the domain object to obtain the identity of the user interacting with said object.

If xref:refguide:applib:index/services/sudo/SudoService.adoc[SudoService] has been used to temporarily override the user and/or roles, then this service will report the overridden values instead.

== Members

[#currentUser__]
=== currentUser()

Optionally gets the details about the current user, based on whether an xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/ExecutionContext.adoc[ExecutionContext] can be found with the current thread's context.

[#getUser__]
=== getUser()

Gets the details about the current user.

[#currentUserElseFail__]
=== currentUserElseFail()

Gets the details about the current user.

[#currentUserName__]
=== currentUserName()

Optionally gets the the current user's name, based on whether an xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/ExecutionContext.adoc[ExecutionContext] can be found with the current thread's context.

[#currentUserNameElseNobody__]
=== currentUserNameElseNobody()

Returns either the current user's name or else _Nobody_ .

[#impersonateUser__String_List]
=== impersonateUser(String, List)

Allows implementations to override the current user with another user.

This is intended for non-production environments only, where it can be invaluable (from a support perspective) to be able to quickly use the application "as if" logged in as another user.

[#stopImpersonating__]
=== stopImpersonating()

For implementations that support impersonation, this is to programmatically stop impersonating a user

Intended to be called at some point after _#impersonateUser(String, List)_ would have been called.

[#supportsImpersonation__]
=== supportsImpersonation()

Whether this implementation supports impersonation.

[#getImpersonatedUser__]
=== getImpersonatedUser()

The impersonated user, if it has previously been set.

[#isImpersonating__]
=== isImpersonating()

Whether or not the user currently reported (in _#currentUser()_ and similar) is actually an impersonated user.
