== Implementation

The core framework itself defines only an SPI for this service; there is no default implementation.
Rather, the implementation will depend on the security mechanism being used.

=== SecMan

If you have configured your app to use the xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[SecMan extension] then note that it _does_ provide an abstract implementation (`SecurityModuleAppUserRegistrationServiceAbstract`) of the `UserRegistrationService`.
You will need to extend that service and provide implementation for the two abstract methods: `getInitialRole()` and `getAdditionalInitialRoles()`.
This is needed so that the self-registered users are assigned automatically to your application role(s) and be able to use the application.
Without any role such user will be able only to see/use the logout link of the application.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Service
public class AppUserRegistrationService
        extends SecurityModuleAppUserRegistrationServiceAbstract {

    protected ApplicationRole getInitialRole() {
        return applicationRoles.findRoleByName("regular-user");
    }
    protected Set<ApplicationRole> getAdditionalInitialRoles() {
        return Collections.singleton(
            applicationRoles.findRoleByName("self-registered-user"));
    }

    @Inject ApplicationRoles applicationRoles;
}
