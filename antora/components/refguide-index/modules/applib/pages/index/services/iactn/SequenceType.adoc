[#EXECUTION]
=== EXECUTION

Numbers the executions (an action invocation or property edit) within a given xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] .

Each xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] is initiated by an execution of action invocation or a property edit. Thereafter there could be multiple other executions as the result of nested calls using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.adoc[WrapperFactory] .

Another possible reason is support for bulk action invocations.

[#TRANSACTION]
=== TRANSACTION

Numbers the transactions within a given xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] .

Each xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] is executed within the context of a transaction, but the (occasionally) the transaction may be committed and a new one started as the result of the domain object using the _org.apache.isis.applib.services.xactn.TransactionService_ .
