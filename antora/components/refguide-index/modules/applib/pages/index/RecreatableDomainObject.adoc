[#__isis_memento__]
=== __isis_memento()

Obtain a memento of the recreatable object.

Typically this will be the identifier of a backing domain entity, but it could also be an arbitrary string, for example a bunch of JSON.

This method is called by the framework in order that the view model may be recreated subsequently through _#__isis_recreate(String)_ .

[#__isis_recreate__String]
=== __isis_recreate(String)

Used to recreate a recreatable object with a memento obtained from _#__isis_recreate(String)_ .
