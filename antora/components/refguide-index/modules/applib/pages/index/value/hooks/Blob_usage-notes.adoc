== Usage Notes

Mandatory properties of this type can be mapped with xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] using:

[source,java]
----
import javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent;
import javax.jdo.annotations.Column;

@Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false", columns = {
    @Column(name = "someImage_name"
            , allowsNull = "false"),
    @Column(name = "someImage_mimetype"
            , allowsNull = "false"),
    @Column(name = "someImage_bytes"
            , allowsNull = "false")
})
private Blob someImage;
----

while optional properties can be mapped the same, but using `allowsNull = "true` for each of the ``@Column``s.
