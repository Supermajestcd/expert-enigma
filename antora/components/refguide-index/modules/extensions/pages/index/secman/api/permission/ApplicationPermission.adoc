Specifies how a particular _#getRole() application role_ may interact with a specific xref:refguide:applib:index/services/appfeat/ApplicationFeature.adoc[ApplicationFeature] .

Each permission has a _#getRule() rule_ and a _#getMode() mode_ . The xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/api/permission/ApplicationPermissionRule.adoc[ApplicationPermissionRule] determines whether the permission _ApplicationPermissionRule#ALLOW grants_ access to the feature or _ApplicationPermissionRule#VETO veto_ es access to it. The xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/api/permission/ApplicationPermissionMode.adoc[ApplicationPermissionMode] indicates whether the role can _ApplicationPermissionMode#VIEWING view_ the feature or can _ApplicationPermissionMode#CHANGING change_ the state of the system using the feature.

For a given permission, there is an interaction between the xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/api/permission/ApplicationPermissionRule.adoc[ApplicationPermissionRule] and the xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/api/permission/ApplicationPermissionMode.adoc[ApplicationPermissionMode] :

* for an _ApplicationPermissionRule#ALLOW allow_ , a _ApplicationPermissionMode#CHANGING usability_ allow implies _ApplicationPermissionMode#VIEWING visibility_ allow.
* conversely, for a _ApplicationPermissionRule#VETO veto_ , a _ApplicationPermissionMode#VIEWING visibility_ veto implies a _ApplicationPermissionMode#CHANGING usability_ veto.
