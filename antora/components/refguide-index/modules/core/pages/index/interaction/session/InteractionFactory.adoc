The factory of _InteractionSession_ (s) and _AuthenticationLayer_ (s), also holding a reference to the current authentication layer stack using a thread-local.

The implementation is a singleton service.

== Members

[#openInteraction__]
=== openInteraction()

If present, reuses the current top level _AuthenticationLayer_ , otherwise creates a new anonymous one.

[#openInteraction__Authentication]
=== openInteraction(Authentication)

Returns a new or reused _AuthenticationLayer_ that is a holder of xref:refguide:core:index/security/authentication/Authentication.adoc[Authentication] on top of the current thread's authentication layer stack.

If available reuses an existing _InteractionSession_ , otherwise creates a new one.

The _InteractionSession_ represents a user's span of activities interacting with the application. The session's stack is later closed using _#closeSessionStack()_ .

[#isInInteraction__]
=== isInInteraction()

[#callAuthenticated__Authentication_Callable]
=== callAuthenticated(Authentication, Callable)

Executes a block of code with a new or reused _InteractionSession_ using a new or reused _AuthenticationLayer_ .

If there is currently no _InteractionSession_ a new one is created.

If there is currently an _AuthenticationLayer_ that has an equal xref:refguide:core:index/security/authentication/Authentication.adoc[Authentication] to the given one, it is reused, otherwise a new one is created.

[#runAuthenticated__Authentication_ThrowingRunnable]
=== runAuthenticated(Authentication, ThrowingRunnable)

Variant of _#callAuthenticated(Authentication, Callable)_ that takes a runnable.

[#callAnonymous__Callable]
=== callAnonymous(Callable)

Executes a block of code with a new or reused _InteractionSession_ using a new or reused _AuthenticationLayer_ .

If there is currently no _InteractionSession_ a new one is created and a new anonymous _AuthenticationLayer_ is returned. Otherwise both, session and layer are reused.

[#runAnonymous__ThrowingRunnable]
=== runAnonymous(ThrowingRunnable)

Variant of _#callAnonymous(Callable)_ that takes a runnable.

[#closeSessionStack__]
=== closeSessionStack()

closes all open _AuthenticationLayer_ (s) as stacked on the current thread
