To get started with a new application, use one of the two git repos on Github that provide a starter app.

* link:https://github.com/apache/isis-app-helloworld[HelloWorld]
+
This is a very minimal app, intended just as a starting point to learn what the framework is all about.
+
[source,bash]
----
REPO=isis-app-helloworld
BRANCH=master

curl "https://codeload.github.com/apache/$REPO/zip/$BRANCH" | jar xv
mv $REPO-$BRANCH $REPO
cd $REPO

mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
----

* link:https://github.com/apache/isis-app-simpleapp[Simple App]
+
This app has the same functionality as _HelloWorld_, but is structured so it can be used as a starting point for developing your own applications.
+
[source,bash]
----
REPO=isis-app-simpleapp
BRANCH=master

curl "https://codeload.github.com/apache/$REPO/zip/$BRANCH" | jar xv
mv $REPO-$BRANCH $REPO
cd $REPO

mvn clean install
mvn -pl webapp spring-boot:run
----
+
It also includes some xref:testing:integ-test-support[integration tests], xref:testing:fixtures:about.adoc[fixtures], and xref:testing:spec-support[BDD (Cucumber)] specs.

In both cases you can bump to newer versions of the framework just by updating the `<version>` of the `<parent>`:

[source,bash]
.pom.xml
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>  <!--1-->
</parent>
----
<1> update as required.
