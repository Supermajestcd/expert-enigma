== Switch between repos

It's common to have to work with multiple git repositories, either making up different modules in your own application or perhaps third-party open source.

You'll probably have these checked out in one or more directories; such as all github repos living under `/c/github/` (or `~/github`), all repos from bitbucket under `/c/bitbucket`, and so on.

The link:{attachmentsdir}/.bash_functions[.bash_functions] provides a handy `repo` function that allows you to switch between these directories just by specifying a portion of the fully qualified name.

Suppose you've cloned https://github.com/apache/isis-app-simpleapp to `/c/github/apache/isis-app-simpleapp`.
Then:

[source,sh]
----
$ repo simple
----

will use regex to match ".*simple.*", and therefore `cd` to the `/c/github/apache/isis-app-simpleapp` directory.


To install:

* copy the link:{attachmentsdir}/.bash_functions[.bash_functions] script to your home directory

* modify the `REPOSROOTS` variable in the script
+
[source,sh]
.~/.bash_functions
----
...
#
# adjust as necessary...
#
REPOSROOTS="/c/GITHUB /c/BITBUCKET /c/GITLAB"
...
----

* source the function from `.bashrc`:
+
[source,sh]
.~/.bashrc
----
. ./.bash_functions
----
