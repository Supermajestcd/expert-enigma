When writing integration tests, it's easiest to inherit from the `IntegrationTestAbstract3` base class.

This base class xref:ug:tst:integ-test-support/bootstrapping.adoc[bootstraps] the framework (caching the framework on a thread-local), and provides various utility methods and framework-provided services for use by your application's subclass tests.



== `IntegrationTestAbstract3`

We recommend that your integration tests inherit from Apache Isis' `IntegrationTestAbstract3` class.
The primary benefit over its predecessor, `IntegrationTestAbstract2` (discussed xref:ug:tst:integ-test-support/abstract-class/adoc#IntegrationTestAbstract2[below] is that it allows the test to be bootstrapped by passing in a `Module` rather than an `AppManifest`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class DomainAppIntegTest
                        extends IntegrationTestAbstract3 {

    public DomainAppIntegTestAbstract() {
        super(new DomainAppApplicationModule());
    }
}
----

The `IntegrationTestAbstract3` class also allows the module to be specified externally, using either the `isis.integTest.module` or the (more general) `isis.headless.module` system property, eg by updating the `pom.xml`.

For example:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <isis.integTest.module>
        org.estatio.module.application.EstatioApplicationModule
    </isis.integTest.module>
</properties>
----

This is required when the codebase is organised as multiple "logical" modules within a single Maven "physical" module (ie `src/main/java` compilation unit).
The integration testing framework will bootstrap the module specified by the system property and cache for all tests discovered within the physical module.



This test class provides a number of helper/convenience methods and JUnit rules:

[source,java]
----
@Rule
public IsisTransactionRule isisTransactionRule =                         // <1>
    new IsisTransactionRule();
@Rule
public JUnitRuleMockery2 context =                                       // <2>
    JUnitRuleMockery2.createFor(Mode.INTERFACES_AND_CLASSES);
@Rule
public ExpectedException expectedExceptions =                            // <3>
    ExpectedException.none();
@Rule
public ExceptionRecognizerTranslate exceptionRecognizerTranslations =    // <4>
    ExceptionRecognizerTranslate.create();
----
<1> ensures an Apache Isis session/transaction running for each test
<2> sets up a JMock context (using Apache Isis' extension to JMock as described in xref:ug:tst:unit-test-support/jmock-extensions.adoc[JMock Extensions].
<3> standard JUnit rule for writing tests that throw exceptions
<4> to capture messages that require translation, as described in xref:ug:btb:i18n.adoc[i18 support].

All of these rules could be inlined in your own base class; as we say, they are a convenience.

The class also provides a number of injected domain services,  notably
xref:rg:svc:persistence-layer-api/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`], xref:rg:svc:core-domain-api/FactoryService.adoc[`FactoryService`], xref:rg:svc:metadata-api/ServiceRegistry.adoc[`ServiceRegistry2`], xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/WrapperFactory.adoc[`WrapperFactory`] (to wrap objects simulating interaction through the user interface), xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/TransactionService.adoc[`TransactionService`] (most commonly used to commit changes after the fixture setup) and xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/SessionManagementService.adoc[`SessionManagementService`] (for tests that check interactions over multiple separate sessions).
