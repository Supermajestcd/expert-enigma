// TODO: v2: extend this/fix for Spring Boot scopes; does it support CDI annotation? which other scopes are supported?

By default all domain services are considered to be singletons, and thread-safe.

Sometimes though a service's lifetime is applicable only to a single request; in other words it is request-scoped.

The CDI annotation xref:rg:ant:RequestScoped.adoc[`@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`] is used to indicate this fact:

[source,java]
----
@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped
public class MyService extends AbstractService {
    ...
}
----

The framework provides a number of request-scoped services, include a xref:rg:svc:core-domain-api/Scratchpad.adoc[`Scratchpad`] service query results caching through the xref:rg:svc:persistence-layer-api/QueryResultsCache.adoc[`QueryResultsCache`], and support for co-ordinating bulk actions through the xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/ActionInvocationContext.adoc[`ActionInvocationContext`] service.  See the xref:rg:svc:about.adoc[domain services] reference guide for further details.
