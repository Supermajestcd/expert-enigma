The Wicket viewer allows you to customize the GUI in several (progressively more sophisticated) ways:

* by xref:ug:vw:customisation/tweaking-css-classes.adoc[tweaking the UI using CSS]
* by xref:ug:vw:customisation/custom-javascript.adoc[tweaking the UI using Javascript]
* by writing a xref:ug:vw:extending/custom-bootstrap-theme.adoc[custom bootstrap theme]
* by xref:ug:vw:extending/replacing-page-elements.adoc[replacing elements of the page] using the `ComponentFactory` interface
* by implementing xref:ug:vw:extending/custom-pages.adoc[replacement page implementations] for the standard page types

The first two of these options are discussed in the xref:ug:vw:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] chapter.  This chapter describes the remaining "heavier-weight/more powerful" options.

The chapter wraps up with a technique for prototyping, allowing user/passwords to be specified as query arguments.
