= Maven Archetypes
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Apache Isis provides two different Maven archetypes to use as a "quick start" for your applications.

* the xref:arch:helloworld:about.adoc[helloworld] archetype is a single Maven module that contains the absolute minimum; there are not tests or fixture scripts, just a single entity and domain service

* the xref:arch:simpleapp:about.adoc[simpleapp] archetype is similar to "helloworld", however it provides more structure and guidance:

** it is broken up into several Maven modules, separating out the bootstrapping code from the domain logic.
** it contains examples of unit tests, integration tests and BDD (cucumber) specs.

+
The simpleapp archetype's functionality is still minimal though: just a single entity, a domain service and a home page.

Follow the links above for more details on getting started with these archetypes.


== Prerequisites

Apache Isis is a Java based framework, so in terms of prerequisites, you'll need to install:

* Java 8 JDK
* link:http://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven] 3.5+

You'll probably also want to use an IDE; the Apache Isis committers use either IntelliJ or Eclipse; in the xref:support:dg:ide.adoc[Developers' Guide] we have detailed setup instructions for using these two IDEs.
If you're a NetBeans user you should have no problems as it too has strong support for Maven.

When building and running within an IDE, you'll also need to configure the Datanucleus enhancer.
This is implemented as a Maven plugin, so in the case of IntelliJ, it's easy enough to run the enhancer as required.
It should be just as straightforward for NetBeans too.

For Eclipse the maven integration story is a little less refined.
All is not lost, however; DataNucleus also has an implementation of the enhancer as an Eclipse plugin, which usually works well enough.
