This page provides user/config guides for each of the main components of the frameworks (viewer, object store and security).

== Overview

xref:core:_overview:about.adoc[System Overview]

== Viewers

The framework provides two viewers that will automatically render the domain objects in your application into the presentation layer:

* xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket)]
+
Provides a human-usable UI, implemented using https://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket], and styled using Bootstrap.

* xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[REST API (Restful Objects)]
+
Presents your domain objects in JSON representations, compliant either with link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects] specification or one of a number of other representations.


== Security

The xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[Security Guide] describes how to configure each of the various security implementations that integrate with Apache Isis.


== Persistence

The framework allows xref:userguide:fun:overview.adoc#domain-entities[domain entities] to be persisted using the xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus object store], for use with the JDO API.

Alternatively, if you restrict yourself to xref:userguide:fun:overview.adoc#view-models[view models] then these can be persisted with any data persistence technology that is supported by Spring Boot.


== Extensions

The xref:extensions:ROOT:about.adoc[Extensions Catalog] describes a number of extensions for the various components of the framework itself.

For example, the "Excel Download" extension allows collections to be downloaded as an Excel `.xlsx` spreadsheet in the Wicket viewer.

As well as the current extensions,  the xref:incubator:ROOT:about.adoc[Incubator] has additional extensions that may end up graduating to the extensions catalog, while the xref:legacy:ROOT:about.adoc[Legacy Catalog] may contain extensions that have been deprecated and are on the way out.
