== Prerequisites:

The prerequisites to install are:

* Node LTS
* Antora

See the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/install/install-antora/[Antora docs] for details.

We also generate some Asciidoc files dynamically from other source code.
This requires:

* link:https://groovy.apache.org/download.html[Groovy 2.x]

* link:https://pandoc.org/installing.html[pandoc]


Also strongly recommended:

* IntelliJ link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[Asciidoc plugin]
+
TIP: even if you don't use IntelliJ as your primary IDE, it's worth using it for writing documentation - there's currently nothing as good as this plugin on any other editor platform, especially when it comes to Antora.


== Build

To build the website:

* use `build-site.sh`; or even better ...
* use `preview.sh`, to build and then preview in a web browser

Both scripts can be found at the root of this git repo.
