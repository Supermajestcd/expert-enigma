The Apache Isis website and documentation are written in link:https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoc], using link:https://antora.org/[Antora] as a static website generator.

== Prerequisites:

The prerequisites to install are:

* Node LTS (link:https://nodejs.org/[])
* Antora (comprising: link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@antora/cli[@antora/cli] and link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@antora/site-generator-default[@antora/site-generator-default])

* Asciidoctor Kroki (link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciidoctor-kroki[asciidoctor-kroki])
+
for diagramming support for Antora

Assuming you have installed the latest Node LTS, these can be installed using:

[source,bash]
----
npm i -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default asciidoctor-kroki
----

See the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install/install-antora/[Antora docs] for details.

We also generate some Asciidoc files dynamically from other source code.
This requires:

* link:https://groovy.apache.org/download.html[Groovy 2.x]

* link:https://pandoc.org/installing.html[pandoc]


== Authoring

To create/update documentation, we strongly recommend:

* IntelliJ link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[Asciidoc plugin]
* IntelliJ link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15635-diagrams-net-integration[Diagrams.net plugin]

Even if you don't use IntelliJ as your primary IDE, it's worth using it for writing documentation - there's currently nothing as good as the Asciidoc plugin on any other editor platform, especially when it comes to writing Antora.


== Build

To build the website:

* use `build-site.sh`; or even better ...
* use `preview.sh`, to build and then preview in a web browser

Both scripts can be found at the root of this git repo.


== Updating the Generated System Overview

The xref:refguide:_overview:about.adoc[System Overview] contains a set of `.adoc` files that are generated from Java classes.
