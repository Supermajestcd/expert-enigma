<.> `[teal]#*fromObjectType*#(String objectType)` : `Class<?>`
+
--
Provides a reverse lookup of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#objectType()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis'ObjectSpecIdFacet).

<.> `[teal]#*toObjectType*#(Class<?> domainType)` : `String`
+
--
Provides a lookup of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#objectType()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis'ObjectSpecIdFacet).

<.> `[teal]#*getDomainModel*#()` : `xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/metamodel/DomainModel.adoc[DomainModel]`
+
--
Returns a list of representations of each of member of each domain class.

Used by xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/metamodel/MetaModelServiceMenu.adoc[MetaModelServiceMenu] to return a downloadable CSV.

Note that _MetaModelService#exportMetaModel(Config)_ provides a superset of the functionality provided by this method.
