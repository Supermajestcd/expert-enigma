== Examples
// ISIS-2524: if any example is found in src/test/java, then it is copied over to the examples folder and post-processed so that callouts in the .java file are copied down below the [source] section.  if there are no examples, then this section is omitted completely.

<.> non-idempotent action (this is the default, so could be omitted)
<.> emits this event on the internal event bus, allowing subscribers to react to or possibly veto the action
<.> emits the action invocation event in serialized form to the configured ExecutionPublisher service, typically to interact with external systems
<.> associates the action with the "orders" member (probably a collection in this case).  In this example this acts solely as a UI hint.
