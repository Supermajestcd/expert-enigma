<.> `[teal]#*__isis_save*#()` : `void`
+
--
Programmatic equivalent of invoking save for a transient object .

NOTE: domain classes may not have a method with this name. The `__isis_` prefix is intended to reduce the risk of a collision.
--
<.> `[teal]#*__isis_wrapped*#()` : `Object`
+
--
Provide access to the underlying, wrapped object.

Used to unwrap objects used as arguments to actions (otherwise, end up creating a `ObjectSpecification` for the Javassist-enhanced class, not the original class).

NOTE: domain classes may not have a method with this name. The `__isis_` prefix is intended to reduce the risk of a collision.

 *NOTE: there is a string-literal reference to this name `DomainObjectInvocationHandler` , so it should not be changed.* .

<.> `[teal]#*__isis_executionModes*#()` : `ImmutableEnumSet<xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/wrapper/control/ExecutionMode.adoc[ExecutionMode]>`
+
--
The _EnumSetexecution modes_ inferred from the xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/wrapper/control/SyncControl.adoc[SyncControl] with which this wrapper was _WrapperFactory#wrap(Object, SyncControl) created_ .
