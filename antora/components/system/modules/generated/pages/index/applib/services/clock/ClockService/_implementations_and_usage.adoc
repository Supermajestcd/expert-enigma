// ISIS-2524: this section only if an interface
This interface is implemented by:

* `org.apache.isis.core.runtimeservices.clock.ClockServiceDefault`.


// ISIS-2524: it's possible that we could have multiple implementations, in which case we would want to have subsections for each possibly implementation.  Each would identify the implementation, and then provide the usage instructions.


// ISIS-2524: for this section, we specify usage of an implementation of there is one.  For annotations and concrete classes, it will be the owning module of the class itself.
To use this type:

* `@Import` the `IsisModuleCoreRuntimeServices` module either directly or indirectly:
+
[source,java]
----
import org.apache.isis.core.runtimeservices.*;

@Configuration
@Import({
    IsisModuleCoreRuntimeServices.class,
    ...
})
...
public class MyModule {
}
----

* add the Maven dependency:
+
[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-core-runtimeservices</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ...
