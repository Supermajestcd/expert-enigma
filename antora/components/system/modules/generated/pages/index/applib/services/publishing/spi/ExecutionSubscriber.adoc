SPI that allows individual interactions (action invocations or property edits) to be _#publish(Interaction.Execution) published_ . Note that re-publishing is not part of this SPI.

Publish each _Interaction.Execution_ immediately after it completes.

Most implementations are expected to use _Interaction.Execution#getDto()_ to create a serializable XML representation of the execution. The easiest way to do this is using _InteractionDtoUtils#newInteractionDto(Interaction.Execution)_ . There is some flexibility here, though.
