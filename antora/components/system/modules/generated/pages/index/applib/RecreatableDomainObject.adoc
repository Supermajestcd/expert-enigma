Indicates that the domain object can be recreated from a string.

Objects that are view models (logically belonging to the UI/application layer) should instead implement _org.apache.isis.applib.ViewModel_ .

interface RecreatableDomainObject {

  String __isis_memento() // <.>

  void __isis_recreate(String memento) // <.>
}

<.> `[teal]#*__isis_memento*#()` : `String`

--
Obtain a memento of the recreatable object.

Typically this will be the identifier of a backing domain entity, but it could also be an arbitrary string, for example a bunch of JSON.

This method is called by the framework in order that the view model may be recreated subsequently through _#__isis_recreate(String)_ .

<.> `[teal]#*__isis_recreate*#(String memento)` : `void`
+
--
Used to recreate a recreatable object with a memento obtained from _#__isis_recreate(String)_ .
