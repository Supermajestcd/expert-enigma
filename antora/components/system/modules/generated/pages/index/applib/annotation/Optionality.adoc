enum Optionality {

  NOT_SPECIFIED // <.>

<.> `[teal]#*_DEFAULT_*#`

--
Default, usually meaning mandatory for properties and always meaning mandatory for parameters.

For properties, will be false unless JDOjavax.jdo.annotations.Columnhas also specified withjavax.jdo.annotations.Column#allowsNull()set totrue.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_OPTIONAL_*#`
+
--
Indicates that the property or parameter is not required.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_MANDATORY_*#`
+
--
Indicates that the property is required (even if the JDOjavax.jdo.annotations.Columnannotation says otherwise).

When using the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore, it is sometimes necessary to annotate a property as optional (usingjavax.jdo.annotations.Column#allowsNull()set totrue), even if the property is logically mandatory. For example, this can occur when the property is in a subtype class that has been "rolled up" to the superclass table usingjavax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance> with thejavax.jdo.annotations.InheritanceStrategy#SUPERCLASS_TABLEsuperclass strategy.

This annotation, therefore, is intended to override any objectstore-specific annotation, so that Isis can apply the constraint even though the objectstore is unable to do so.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_NOT_SPECIFIED_*#`
+
--
Ignore the value provided by this annotation (meaning that the framework will keep searching, in meta annotations or superclasses/interfaces).
