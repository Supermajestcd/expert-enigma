<.> `[teal]#*_FIRST_*#` : `int`
+
--
For domain services with the highest precedence value. No framework services use this constant, but some very fundamental services (eg for security) that are not expected to be overridden use a value that is only a little after this first value.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_EARLY_*#` : `int`
+
--
For framework for services that are unlikely to be overridden by application code.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_MIDPOINT_*#` : `int`
+
--
For framework for services that could be overridden by application code (though not commonly).
--
<.> `[teal]#*_LATE_*#` : `int`
+
--
For framework services that are expected to be overridden by application code, or that act as a fallback.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_LAST_*#` : `int`
+
--
For domain services that act as a fallback, and which will typically be overridden.
