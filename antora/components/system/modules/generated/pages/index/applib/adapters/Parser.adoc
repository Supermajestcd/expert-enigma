Provides a mechanism for parsing and rendering string representations of objects.

Specifically, this interface embodies three related capabilities:

* to parse a string representation and convert to an object.
* to provide a string representation of the object, for use as its title.
* to indicate the typical length of such a string representation.

For custom-written (as opposed to third-party) value types, the ability for the xref:system:generated:index/applib/adapters/Parser.adoc[Parser] to provide a title responsibilities overlap with other conventions for domain objects. Specifically, normally we write a `title()` method to return a title. In such cases a typical implementation of xref:system:generated:index/applib/adapters/Parser.adoc[Parser] would just delegate to the value type itself to obtain the title (ie invoking the `title()` method directly rather than having the framework do this).

Similarly, the ability to return a typical length also overlaps with the _TypicalLength_ annotation; which is why _TypicalLength_ cannot be applied to types, only to properties and parameters.

For third-party value types, eg _http://timeandmoney.sourceforge.net/ Time-and-Money_ there is no ability to write `title()` methods or annotated with _TypicalLength_ ; so this is the main reason that this interface has to deal with titles and lengths.

This interface is used in two complementary ways:

* As one option, it allows objects to take control of their own parsing, by implementing directly. However, the instance is used as a factory for itself. The framework will instantiate an instance, invoke the appropriate method method, and use the returned object. The instantiated instance itself will be discarded.
* Alternatively, an implementor of this interface can be nominated in the _org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.Parseable_ annotation, allowing a class that needs to be parseable to indicate how it can be parsed.

Whatever the class that implements this interface, it must also expose either a `public` no-arg constructor, or (for implementations that also are `Facet` s) a `public` constructor that accepts a single `FacetHolder` . This constructor allows the framework to instantiate the object reflectively.

<.> `[teal]#*parseTextEntry*#(Object contextPojo, String entry)` : `T`
+
--
Parses a string to an instance of the object.

Note that here the implementing class is acting as a factory for itself.
--
<.> `[teal]#*typicalLength*#()` : `int`
+
--
The typical length of objects that can be parsed.
--
<.> `[teal]#*displayTitleOf*#(T object)` : `String`
+
--
The title of the object.
--
<.> `[teal]#*displayTitleOf*#(T object, String usingMask)` : `String`
+
--
The title of the object using a mask.
--
<.> `[teal]#*parseableTitleOf*#(T existing)` : `String`
+
--
A title for the object that is valid but which may be easier to edit than the title provided by aTitleFacet.

The idea here is that the viewer can display a parseable title for an existing object when, for example, the user initially clicks in the field. So, a date might be rendered via aTitleFacetas `May 2, 2007` , but its editable form might be `20070502` .
--
<.> `[teal]#*maxLength*#()` : `int`
+
--
The max length of objects that can be parsed (if any). A return type of -1 corresponds to unlimited.
