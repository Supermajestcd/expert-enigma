[#associatewith]
= associateWith()

[source,java]
----
@interface Action {
  // ...
  String associateWith() default "";
= `associateWith` : `String`
  // ...
----

Associates this action with a property or collection, specifying its id.

This is an alternative to using _MemberOrder#name()_ . To specify the order (equivalent to _MemberOrder#sequence()_ }), use _#associateWithSequence()_ .

For example@Action(associateWith="items", associateWithSequence="2.1")

If an action is associated with a collection, then any matching parameters will have their choices automatically inferred from the collection (if not otherwise specified) and any collection parameter defaults can be specified using checkboxes (in the Wicket UI, at least).
