[#domainevent]
= domainEvent()

[source,java]
----
@interface Action {
  // ...
    Class<? extends ActionDomainEvent<?>> domainEvent() default ActionDomainEvent.Default.class;
  // ...
}
----

Indicates that an invocation of the action should be posted to the _org.apache.isis.applib.services.eventbus.EventBusService event bus_ using a custom (subclass of) xref:system:generated:index/applib/events/domain/ActionDomainEvent.adoc[ActionDomainEvent] .

For example:

----
public class SomeObject{
    public static class ChangeStartDateDomainEvent extends ActionDomainEvent<SomeObject> { ... }

    @Action(domainEvent=ChangedStartDateDomainEvent.class)
    public void changeStartDate(final Date startDate) { ...}
    ...
}
----

This subclass must provide a no-arg constructor; the fields are set reflectively.
