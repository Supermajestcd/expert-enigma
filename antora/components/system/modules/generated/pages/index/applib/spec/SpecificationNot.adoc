Adapter to make it easy to perform boolean algebra on xref:system:generated:index/applib/spec/Specification.adoc[Specification] s.

Subclasses represent the logical inverse of a xref:system:generated:index/applib/spec/Specification.adoc[Specification] s. An implementation should instantiate the xref:system:generated:index/applib/spec/Specification.adoc[Specification] s to be satisfied in its constructor.

For example:

----

public class NoSugarThanksSpec extends SpecificationNot {
    public NoSugarThanksSpec() {
        super(
            new TwoLumpsOfSugarSpec(),
        );
    }
}
