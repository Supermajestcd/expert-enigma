<.> `[teal]#*_SAFE_AND_REQUEST_CACHEABLE_*#`
+
--
Safe, with no side effects, and caching the returned value when invoked multiple times in the same request.

* Changes state: *No*
* HTTP verb: *GET*
* Effect of multiple calls: Will *always return the same result* each time invoked (within a given request scope).
--
<.> `[teal]#*_SAFE_*#`
+
--
Safe, with no side-effects. In other words, a query-only action.

* Changes state: *No*
* HTTP verb: *GET*
* Effect of multiple calls: Might result in *different results each invocation* (within a given request scope).
--
<.> `[teal]#*_IDEMPOTENT_*#`
+
--
Post-conditions are always the same, irrespective as to how many times called.

* Changes state: *Yes*
* HTTP verb: *PUT*
* Effect of multiple calls: Will make *no further changes* if called multiple times (eg sets a property or adds of same item to a Set).
--
<.> `[teal]#*_NON_IDEMPOTENT_*#`
+
--
Neither safe nor idempotent; every invocation is likely to change the state of the object.

* Changes state: *Yes*
* HTTP verb: *POST*
* Effect of multiple calls: Might *change the state* of the system each time called (eg increments a counter or adds to a List).
* Example: Increasing the quantity of a line item in an Order by 1.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_IDEMPOTENT_ARE_YOU_SURE_*#`
+
--
Post-conditions are always the same, irrespective as to how many times called.

If supported the UI viewer will show a confirmation dialog before executing the action.

* Changes state: *Yes*
* HTTP verb: *PUT*
* Effect of multiple calls: Will make *no further changes* if called multiple times (eg sets a property or adds of same item to a Set).

<.> `[teal]#*_NOT_SPECIFIED_*#`
+
--
Ignore the value provided by this annotation (meaning that the framework will keep searching, in meta annotations or superclasses/interfaces).
--
<.> `[teal]#*isIdempotentInNature*#()` : `boolean`
+
--
Any of _#SAFE_ , _#SAFE_AND_REQUEST_CACHEABLE_ or (obviously) _#IDEMPOTENT_ .
--
<.> `[teal]#*isSafeInNature*#()` : `boolean`
+
--
Either of _#SAFE_ or _#SAFE_AND_REQUEST_CACHEABLE_ .
--
<.> `[line-through gray]#*isSafe*#()` : `boolean`
+

[WARNING]
====
[red]#_deprecated:_#

- use _#isSafeInNature()_ instead (avoid any ambiguity).
