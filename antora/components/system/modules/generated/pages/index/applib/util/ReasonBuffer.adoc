Helper class to create properly concatenated reason string for use in method that return _String_ s with reasons.

If no reasons are specified _#getReason()_ will returnnull, otherwise it will return a _String_ with all the valid reasons concatenated with a semi-colon separating each one.

An alternative is to use the xref:system:generated:index/applib/util/Reasons.adoc[Reasons] class.
