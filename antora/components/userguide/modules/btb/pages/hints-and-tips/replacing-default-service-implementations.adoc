The framework provides default implementations for many of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:about.adoc[domain services].
This is convenient, but sometimes you will want to replace the default implementation with your own service implementation.

For example, suppose you wanted to provide your own implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/i18n/LocaleProvider.adoc[LocaleProvider].
The trick is to use the Spring link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[@Order] annotation or equivalent mechanism.

Here's how:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.core.Ordered;

@Service
@Order(OrderPrecedence.HIGH)                                // <.>
public class MyLocaleProvider implements LocaleProvider {
    @Override
    public Locale getLocale() {
        // ...
    }
}
----
<.> `OrderPrecedence` (in the Apache Isis applib) provides some standard values.


== Decorating existing implementations

It's sometimes useful to decorate the existing implementation (ie have your own implementation delegate to the default); this is quite easy to imlpement:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.core.Ordered;

@Service
@Order(OrderPrecedence.HIGHEST)                             // <.>
public class MyLocaleProvider implements LocaleProvider {

    @Inject List<LocaleProvider> localeProviders;           // <.>

    @Override
    public Locale getLocale() {
        return localeProviders.stream()                     // <.>
                .filter(x -> x != this)                     // <.>
                .findFirst()                                // <.>
                .map(LocaleProvider::getLocale)             // <.>
                .orElseThrow(RuntimeException::new);        // <.>
    }
}
----
<.> takes precedence over the default implementation when injected elsewhere.
<.> injects all implementations, including this implementation
<.> streams over all implementations...
<.> \...ignoring this one...
<.> \...uses the next one...
<.> \...and delegate to it.
<.> Fails fast if no other implementations available (should not happen if framework provides a default implementation).

[TIP]
====
None of the default implementations provided by the framework use `Ordered(OrderPrecedence.HIGHEST)`, so all can be overridden if required.
