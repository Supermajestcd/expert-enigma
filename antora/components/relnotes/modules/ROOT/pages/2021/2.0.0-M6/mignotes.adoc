== Other Changes

Module `IsisModuleExtCorsImpl` was renamed to `IsisModuleExtCors`. 

Module `IsisModuleExtModelAnnotation` was removed and is no longer required.

Service `BookmarkService` has been improved, such that its methods return `Optional<?>` instead of nullable objects. 

The _Wicket Viewer_ was migrated from using _Bootstrap 3_ to _Bootstrap 4_, which might have more or less severe implications on (your) customized _CSS_ and _JavaScript_ and _Wicket_ components. 

== Extensions

=== SecMan

Following menu actions for User Management have been removed:

[source,xml]
.menubars.layout.xml
----
<!--
<mb3:serviceAction objectType="isis.ext.secman.ApplicationUserMenu" id="newLocalUser">
    <cpt:named>New Local User</cpt:named>
</mb3:serviceAction>
<mb3:serviceAction objectType="isis.ext.secman.ApplicationUserMenu" id="allUsers">
    <cpt:named>All Users</cpt:named>
</mb3:serviceAction>
<mb3:serviceAction objectType="isis.ext.secman.ApplicationUserMenu" id="newDelegateUser">
    <cpt:named>New Delegate User</cpt:named>
</mb3:serviceAction>
-->
----

Use the new User Manager View Model instead:

[source,xml]
.menubars.layout.xml

<mb3:serviceAction objectType="isis.ext.secman.ApplicationUserMenu" id="userManager">
    <cpt:named>User Manager</cpt:named>
</mb3:serviceAction>
