This is a major milestone release that "re-platforms" Apache Isis so that it now runs on top of link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot].

* A new convenience xref:docs:parent-pom:about.adoc[parent pom] builds on top of Spring Boot's similar parent pom, to make it easy to develop new apps, along with simplified xref:docs:mavendeps:about.adoc["mavendeps"] pom's.
* The Maven archetypes have been replaced with xref:docs:starters:about.adoc[Starter Apps] in github repos.
* xref:refguide:config:about.adoc[Configuration properties] have been refactored, and can now be specified (with intellisense hints) using Spring's `application.properties` or `application.yml`

The core framework has been trimmed down, with testing functionality (eg fixture scripts) moving to a new top level "testing" group.
Other new groups have been introduced: "value-types", "subdomains", (bounded context) "mapping", "extensions", "incubator", "legacy".

This milestone also introduces a number of new features:

* new xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc#projecting[@Property#projecting] allows view model summaries to be returned as "projections" of underlying entities.
* new xref:refguide:applib-methods:ui-hints.adoc#layout[layout()] method (or xref:refguide:applib-classes:events.adoc#ui-event-classes[UI event]) allows a domain object to specify which layout file should be used to render it.
* no longer any need to specify xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/ParameterLayout.adoc#named[@ParameterLayout#named()]
* security integration with xref:security:keycloak:about.adoc[Keycloak]

* New value types:
** text-based value type with simple xref:valuetypes:sse:about.adoc[SSE support]
** xref:valuetypes:asciidoc:about.adoc[Asciidoc] value type
** xref:valuetypes:markdown:about.adoc[Markdown] value type

* New extensions:
** xref:userguide:flyway:about.adoc[Flyway] (integrating with Spring Boot's support)
** xref:vro:cors:[CORS] for the REST API (xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[REST API (Restful Objects viewer)])
** xref:vw:pdfjs:about.adoc[pdf.js] (for xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)])
** xref:vw:fullcalendar:about.adoc[fullcalendar] (for xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)])
** xref:vw:exceldownload:about.adoc[excel download] (for xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)])

Improvements:

* xref:testing:integtestsupport:about.adoc[Integration test support], and xref:testing:specsupport:about.adoc[BDD (Cucumber) "spec" support] have been refactored to run on Spring Boot with Junit 5.
* New xref:docs:demo:about.adoc[demo app] to demonstrate new features.
* New smoketest app to catch regressions
* The maven plugin has been retired, replaced by utility classes that can be used within integration tests.
* There are no longer any split packages, and Maven groupId/artifactIds have been rationalized.


The website has been updated to use https://antora.org[Antora].
