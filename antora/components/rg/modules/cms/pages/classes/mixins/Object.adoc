The framework provides a single mixin that contributes to simply `java.lang.Object`.
It provides the ability to download the layout XML for any domain object (in practical terms: entities and view models).

These mixin actions are all associated with the "Metadata" fieldset.
A number of other xref:rg:cms:classes/mixins/Persistable.adoc[mixins] also contribute properties or actions to the "Metadata" fieldset.



== `clearHints()`

When a domain object is rendered the end-user can select different tabs, and for collections can sort the columns,
navigate to second pages, or select different views of collections.
If the user revisits that object, the xref:ug:vw:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] will remember these hints and render the domain object in the same state.
These rendering hints are also included if the user copies the URL using the anchor link (to right hand of the object's title).

The `Object_clearHints` mixin provides the ability for the end-user to discard these hints so that the object is
rendered in its initial state:

[source,java]
----
public void clearHints() {
    ...
}
----

This mixin uses the xref:rg:svc:presentation-layer-spi/HintStore.adoc[`HintStore`] service to store and retrieve UI hints for each rendered object, per user.



== `downloadLayoutXml()`

The `Object_downloadLayoutXml` mixin provides an action to download the xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[layout XML] for the current domain object.
It has the following signature:

[source,java]
----
public Object downloadLayoutXml(
    @ParameterLayout(named = "File name")
    final String fileName,
    final LayoutService.Style style) {          // <1>
    ...
}
----
<1> either current, complete, normalized or minimal.

See the documentation on xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[layout XML] and also
the xref:rg:svc:metadata-api/LayoutService.adoc[`LayoutService`] for more information on these styles


=== Related Services

This mixin calls xref:rg:svc:metadata-api/LayoutService.adoc[`LayoutService`] to obtain the layout XML.




== `rebuildMetamodel()`

The `Object_rebuildMetamodel` mixin provides the ability to discard the current internal metamodel data (an instance of `ObjectSpecification`) for the domain class of the rendered object, and recreate from code and other sources (most notably, layout XML data).
It has the following signature:

[source,java]
----
public void rebuildMetamodel() {
    ...
}
----


=== Related Services

This mixin calls xref:rg:svc:metadata-api/MetamodelService.adoc[`MetaModelService`] and the xref:rg:svc:presentation-layer-spi/GridService.adoc[`GridService`] to invalidate their caches.



== `downloadLayoutXml()`

The `Object_downloadLayoutXml` mixin provides an action to download the xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[layout XML] for the current domain object.
It has the following signature:

[source,java]
----
public Object downloadLayoutXml(
    @ParameterLayout(named = "File name")
    final String fileName,
    final LayoutService.Style style) {          // <1>
    ...
}
----
<1> either current, complete, normalized or minimal.

See the documentation on xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[layout XML] and also
the xref:rg:svc:metadata-api/LayoutService.adoc[`LayoutService`] for more information on these styles


=== Related Services

This mixin calls xref:rg:svc:metadata-api/LayoutService.adoc[`LayoutService`] to obtain the layout XML.



== `openRestApi()`

The `Object_openRestApi` mixin provides an action to navigate to the URL of the xref:ug:vro:about.adoc[Restful Objects resource] corresponding to the domain object.
It has the following signature:

[source,java]
----
public URL openRestApi() { /* ... */ }
----


=== Related Services

This mixin calls xref:rg:svc:integration-api/BookmarkService.adoc[`BookmarkService`] to build the URL.
