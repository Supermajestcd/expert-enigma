The `cssClass()` attribute can be used to render additional CSS classes in the HTML (a wrapping `<div>`) that represents the domain object.
xref:rg:cfg:application-specific/application-css.adoc[Application-specific CSS] can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation of that particular element.


For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
@DomainObjectLayout(
    cssClass="x-core-entity"
)
public class ToDoItem { /* ... */ }
----




[NOTE]
====
The similar xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout/cssClassFa.adoc[`@DomainObjectLayout#cssClassFa()`] annotation attribute is also used as a hint to apply CSS, but in particular to allow http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icons] to be rendered as the icon for classes.
