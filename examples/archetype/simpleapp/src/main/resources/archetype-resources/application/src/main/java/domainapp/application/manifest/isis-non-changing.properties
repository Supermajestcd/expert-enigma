${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Encryption key is used to encrypt the rememberMe user/password.  It should be set to a unique and private value.
${symbol_pound} If a hard-coded and publicly known value is used, then it would be possible for rememberMe user/password to be
${symbol_pound} intercepted and decrypted, compromising access.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} If no value is set then (for safety) a random UUID will be used as the encryption key.  The net effect of this
${symbol_pound} default is that 'rememberMe' will work, but only until the webapp is restarted (after which the end-user will
${symbol_pound} have to log in again).

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} cookie key holding the (encrypted) 'rememberMe' user/password.
${symbol_pound} If not specified then the cookie key 'isisWicketRememberMe' will be used; there is generally no need to change this.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.rememberMe.cookieKey=isisWicketRememberMe


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} specifies whether an INLINE or DIALOG prompt should be used for property edits and for action invocations (of actions
${symbol_pound} associated with a property).  This is a fallback where not specified on a case-by-case using @PropertyLayout or
${symbol_pound} @ActionLayout (or equivalents in the Xxx.layout.xml file).
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} If not specified then the default is an inline prompt.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.promptStyle=INLINE


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} If set then reverts to pre-1.15.0 behaviour of redirecting to a new page on any action invocation or property edit.
