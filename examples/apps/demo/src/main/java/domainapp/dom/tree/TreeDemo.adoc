(since 2.0.0-M1)

This is a lazy tree. Tree nodes are either domain-objects or
domain-views, which are generated on the fly by a specified
link:${SOURCES_ISIS}/org/apache/isis/applib/tree/TreeAdapter.java[TreeAdapter].

[source,java]
----
public interface TreeAdapter<T> {

    public Optional<T> parentOf(T value);
    
    public int childCountOf(T value);
    
    public Stream<T> childrenOf(T value);
    
}
----

We create a tree by starting with it's root node and providing a
`FileSystemTreeAdapter` that implements `TreeAdapter`.

[source,java]
----
public TreeNode<FileNode> createTree() {
    val root = FileNodeFactory.defaultRoot();
    val tree = TreeNode.lazy(root, FileSystemTreeAdapter.class);
    tree.expand(TreePath.of(0)); // expand the root node
    return tree;
}
