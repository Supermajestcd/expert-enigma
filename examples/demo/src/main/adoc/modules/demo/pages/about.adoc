The Demo app provides an introduction to some of the features and components available in Apache Isis.
It is bundled as a Docker image (link:https://hub.docker.com/r/apacheisis/demo-springboot/tags/[apacheisis/demo-springboot]) on Docker Hub.

The app allows you to learn the very basics with a minimum of hassle.
