The framework has built-in support for the `String` data type.

From here you can:

* navigate to an entity that uses the `String` datatype
* open a view model that uses the `String` datatype

Some properties on these domain objects are mandatory, some optional.

== Common interfaces

The entity and view model types both implement some common interfaces.

=== JavaLangStringHolder

The `JavaLangStringHolder` interface is used to contribute a number of mixins to both types:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/JavaLangStringHolder.java[tags=class]
----

=== JavaLangStringHolder2

The `JavaLangStringHolder2` interface is used to demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`.

Further details, along with the effect of this annotation, can be seen on the entity and view model object pages.
