This is an link:https://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] application to demonstrate the programming model for the various features provided by the framework.

On the left hand side of each web page you'll find the feature, and on the right hand side you'll find an explanation of the feature with code examples.

== Page Layout

This is as good place as any to explain the page layout of an Apache Isis webapp:

* At the top is the menu bar.
+
This consists of a *primary menu* (on the left) containing the actions provided by the app's domain service, a *secondary menu* (on the right) which typically contains supporting services provided by the framework itself (eg "Prototyping") or extensions, and the *tertiary menu* for login/logout and inspecting the configuration.

* In the centre (where you're looking now) is the domain object being displayed.
+
This will have an *icon* and *title*, for identification by the user.
A typical web page for a domain objects will show scalar fields for each of the object's *properties*, table grids for each of the object's *collections*, and buttons to represent the *actions*.
Properties and collections are the object's state, actions are the object's behaviour.
+
If running in prototype mode then there are a number of actions contributed by the framework (their label is in _italics_) so you can dig into the internal implementation.

* At the bottom is a menu bar with credits, and to allow the user to *switch theme*.

Click into the application and try things out.

[CAUTION]
====
The demo app uses an in-memory database, so any changes made will be lost when the app is stopped.
