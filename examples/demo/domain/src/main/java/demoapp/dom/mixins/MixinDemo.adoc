(since 2.0)

The framework allows for tiny chunks of domain logic like `Update Name` or `Delete`, 
to be contributed by and encapsulated within separate classes: `Mixins`

`Mixins` contribute their domain logic to a domain object via a single mixed in member, which is one of 

* Action
* Property
* Collection

*Mixed-In Action*

[source,java]
----
@Action(...)              // presence of Action on class implies this is a mixin; 
@ActionLayout(...)
public class Contributee_someAction() {
    private final Contributee contributee;
    public ReturnValue act( ... ) { ... }   // no need for annotations here.   "act" assumed
}
----

*Mixed-In Property*

[source,java]
----
@Property(...)     // implies this class is a mixin
@PropertyLayout(...)
public class Contributee_someProperty()
    private final Contributee contributee;
    public ReturnValue prop() { ... }                    // "prop" is assumed
}
----

*Mixed-In Collection*

[source,java]
----
@Collection(...)     // implies this class is a mixin
@CollectionLayout(...)
public class Contributee_someCollection()
    private final Contributee contributee;
    public List<ReturnValue> coll() { ... }                    // "coll" is assumed
}
