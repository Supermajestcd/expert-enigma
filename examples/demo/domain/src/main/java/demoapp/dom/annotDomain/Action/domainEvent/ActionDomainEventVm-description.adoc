Usually a domain event is emitted by the framework to emit whenever the user interacts with an action.
Domain service subscribers can influence this interaction, either by:

* hiding the action
* disabling the action
* validating arguments of the action invocation
* performing arbitrary operations before the action has been invoked (including modifying the argument values to be used)
* performing arbitrary operations after the action has been modified (including changing the apparent return value of the action)


The `domainEvent` semantic specifies the class to be emitted; this must be a subclass of the abstract `org.apache.isis.applib.events.domain.ActionDomainEvent` class.

If no `domainEvent` is specified on the action itself, then the domain event class can be specified at the class level using `@DomainObject#actionDomainEvent`.
And if not specified at the class level, then an instance of `org.apache.isis.applib.events.domain.ActionDomainEvent.Default` is emitted as the fallback.

[TIP]
====
The fallback domain event can be suppressed using the `isis.applib.annotation.action.domain-event.post-for-default` configuration property.

== Annotated Actions

The demo defines two actions that are annotated using `domainEvent` semantic:

* in the `ActionHiddenVm` is a regular action, "updateText":
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionDomainEventVm.java[tags=class]
----
<.> the event class to emit; genericised by the target type
<.> indicates that the framework should emit this type

* The `ActionHiddenVm_mixinUpdateTextNoAnnotation` defines a mixin action, also annotated:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionDomainEventVm_mixinUpdateText.java[tags=class]
----

<.> the event class to emit; genericised by the target type
+
TIP: it's idiomatic to use a nested static class here.
<.> indicates that the framework should emit this type

== Subscriber

The `ActionDomainEventControlService` is the subscriber:

[source,java]
----
include::subscribers/ActionDomainEventControlService.java[tags=class]
----
<.> holds which "strategy" should be used to modify the interactions with the text field
<.> subscribes using the Spring event bus

== Influencing the Interaction

The mechanisms to influence the interactions are implemented as an enum.
The `DO_NOTHING` enum, unsurprisingly, does nothing:

[source,java]
----
include::subscribers/ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=class]
----

There are seven further options:

* hide (two examples)
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::subscribers/ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=hide]
----

* disable (two examples)
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::subscribers/ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=disable]
----

* validate
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::subscribers/ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=validate]
----

* executing
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::subscribers/ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=executing]
----

* executed
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::subscribers/ActionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=executed]
----

=== Selecting the Strategy

Selecting which strategy is in force is implemented using two mixins which work together:

* the `controlUpdateText` mixin property just surfaces the selected strategy as a read-only value:
+
[source,java]
----
include::subscribers/ActionDomainEventVm_controlUpdateText.java[tags=class]
----

* while the `controlUpdateTextInvocation` mixin action allows the strategy to be changed:
+
[source,java]
----
include::subscribers/ActionDomainEventVm_controlUpdateTextInvocation.java[tags=class]
----
