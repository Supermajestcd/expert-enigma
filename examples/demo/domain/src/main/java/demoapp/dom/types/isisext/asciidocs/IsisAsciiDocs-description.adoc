The framework has built-in support for rendering HTML written including link:https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], using the `AsciiDoc` data type.

NOTE: This is an Apache Isis specific data type.

From here you can:

* navigate to an entity that uses the `AsciiDoc` datatype
* open a view model that uses the `AsciiDoc` datatype

Some properties on these domain objects are mandatory, some optional.

== Common interfaces

The entity and view model types both implement some common interfaces.

=== IsisAsciiDocHolder

The `IsisAsciiDocHolder` interface is used to contribute a number of mixins to both types:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/IsisAsciiDocHolder.java[tags=class]
----

=== IsisAsciiDocHolder2

The `IsisAsciiDocHolder2` interface is used to demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`.

Further details, along with the effect of this annotation, can be seen on the entity and view model object pages.
