The framework has built-in support for all of the primitive data types, including `short`.

From here you can:

* navigate to an entity that uses the `short` datatype
* open a view model that uses the `short` datatype

Because `short` is a primitive value, the properties on these domain objects are mandatory.

== Common interfaces

The entity and view model types both implement some common interfaces.

=== PrimitiveShortHolder

The `PrimitiveShortHolder` interface is used to contribute a number of mixins to both types:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/PrimitiveShortHolder.java[tags=class]
----

=== PrimitiveShortHolder2

The `PrimitiveShortHolder2` interface is used to demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`.

Further details, along with the effect of this annotation, can be seen on the entity and view model object pages.
