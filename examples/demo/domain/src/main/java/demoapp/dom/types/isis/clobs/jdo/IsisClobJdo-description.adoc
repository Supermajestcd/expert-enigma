Apache Isis implements the relevant JDO extension points to allow the `Clob` type to be persisted.
To do so correctly, it requires that the column names for the three constituent parts of a `Clob` are specified using `@Column`.
It's also necessary to specify the `jdbcType` to hold the characters:

[source,java]
----
include::IsisClobJdo.java[tags=class]
----
<.> a no-arg constructor is introduced by JDO enhancer
<.> required property as defined to JDO/DataNucleus.
+
Apache Isis assumes properties are mandatory, so no additional annotation is required.
<.> directly editable property as defined to Apache Isis
<.> optional property as defined to Apache Isis
<.> optional property as defined to JDO/DataNucleus
