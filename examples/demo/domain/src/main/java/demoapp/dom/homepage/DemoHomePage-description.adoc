Apache Isis applications can nominate a view model to act as the home page, using the link:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/${ISIS_VERSION}/applib-ant/HomePage.html[`@HomePage`] annotation:

[source,java]
----
include::DemoHomePage.java[tags="class"]
----

<.> declares this view-model class to be used as the viewer's homepage, there can be only one
<.> contributes the description property on the right hand side (in other words, what you're reading right now).
<.> customises the title, top left
<.> the welcome text, on the left handside
<.> framework-provided service, injected by the framework so that the home page object can find the current user

This application's home page is pretty simple, not much more than a couple of hard-coded text fields that you're reading right now.

A more common implementation of a home page is as a dashboard, displaying the most useful current information to the user (perhaps a task list, or alerts).
Such a home page would have a number of repository services injected into it, in order to query and render those tasks or alerts.

It would probably also have the framework's link:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/${ISIS_VERSION}/applib-svc/UserService.html[`UserService`] injected, in order that the information displayed is relevant to the current user.
As you can see, this app's home page does actually do this, in order to "personalise" the title.
