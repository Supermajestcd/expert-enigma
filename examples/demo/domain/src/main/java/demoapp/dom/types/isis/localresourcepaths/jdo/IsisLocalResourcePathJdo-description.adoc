Apache Isis implements the relevant JDO extension points to allow the `LocalResourcePath` type to be persisted.
No special annotations are required, though `@Column` can be used to fine-tune the mapping.
The most common usage is to indicate whether the column can be null.
Since the column ultimately maps down to a string, the column's length could also be specified:

[source,java]
----
include::IsisLocalResourcePathJdo.java[tags=class]
----
<.> a no-arg constructor is introduced by JDO enhancer
<.> required property as defined to JDO/DataNucleus.
+
Apache Isis assumes properties are mandatory, so no additional annotation is required.
<.> directly editable property as defined to Apache Isis
<.> optional property as defined to Apache Isis
<.> optional property as defined to JDO/DataNucleus
