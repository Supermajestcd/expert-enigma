The framework has built-in support for all of the Wrapper data types, including `Byte`.

From here you can:

* navigate to an entity that uses the `Byte` datatype
* open a view model that uses the `Byte` datatype

Some properties on these domain objects are mandatory, some optional.

== Common interfaces

The entity and view model types both implement some common interfaces.

=== WrapperByteHolder

The `WrapperByteHolder` interface is used to contribute a number of mixins to both types:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/WrapperByteHolder.java[tags=class]
----

=== WrapperByteHolder2

The `WrapperByteHolder2` interface is used to demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`.

Further details, along with the effect of this annotation, can be seen on the entity and view model object pages.
