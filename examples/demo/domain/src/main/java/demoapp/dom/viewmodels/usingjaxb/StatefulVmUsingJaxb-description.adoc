End users interact with link:https://isis.apache.org/userguide/${ISIS_VERSION}/fun/overview.html#view-models[view models] in the same as a domain entity.

However, whereas domain entities are mapped to a datastore, view models are not.
Instead they are recreated dynamically by serializing their state, typically into the URL itself.

The framework provides a number of ways to serialize this state, but the most flexible and standard is to use JAXB annotations:

[source,java]
----
include::StatefulVmUsingJaxb.java[tags=class]
----

<.> mandatory, specifies this is a JAXB element
<.> mandatory boilerplate
<.> serializes the state by reading the field
<.> no further JAXB annotations required for the property.

Notice how the 'message' property can be modified and survives a refresh of the page.

Behind the scenes, the object is converted into an XML serialization, and that is URL encoded.


== Collections

JAXB also handles serializing graphs of data, which means that view models can also have collections of other objects:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::StatefulViewModelUsingJaxb.java[tags=child]
----

The demo provides a couple of actions to allow objects to be added and removed.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::StatefulViewModelUsingJaxb.java[tags=addChild]
----

NOTE: the child object has value-type semantics (is annotated with `@lombok.Data`).


== Long URLs

As you can see this can result in long URLs.
If the URL is too long, or needs to be encrypted, then the link:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/${ISIS_VERSION}/applib-svc/UrlEncodingService.html[`UrlEncodingService`] SPI can provide for different serializations.
