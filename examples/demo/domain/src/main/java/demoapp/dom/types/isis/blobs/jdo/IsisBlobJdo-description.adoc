Apache Isis implements the relevant JDO extension points to allow the `Blob` type to be persisted.
To do so correctly, it requires that the column names for the three constituent parts of a `Blob` are specified using `@Column`:

[source,java]
----
include::IsisBlobJdo.java[tags=class]
----
<.> a no-arg constructor is introduced by JDO enhancer
<.> required property as defined to JDO/DataNucleus.
+
Apache Isis assumes properties are mandatory, so no additional annotation is required.
<.> directly editable property as defined to Apache Isis
<.> optional property as defined to Apache Isis
<.> optional property as defined to JDO/DataNucleus
