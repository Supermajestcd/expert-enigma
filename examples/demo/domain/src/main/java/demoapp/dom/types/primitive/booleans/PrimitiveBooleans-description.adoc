The framework has built-in support for all of the primitive data types, including `boolean`.

From here you can:

* navigate to an entity that uses the `boolean` datatype
* open a view model that uses the `boolean` datatype

Because `boolean` is a primitive value, the properties on these domain objects are mandatory.

== Common interfaces

The entity and view model types both implement some common interfaces.

=== PrimitiveBooleanHolder

The `PrimitiveBooleanHolder` interface is used to contribute a number of mixins to both types:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/PrimitiveBooleanHolder.java[tags=class]
----


=== PrimitiveBooleanHolder2

The `PrimitiveBooleanHolder2` interface is used to demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`.

Further details, along with the effect of this annotation, can be seen on the entity and view model object pages.
