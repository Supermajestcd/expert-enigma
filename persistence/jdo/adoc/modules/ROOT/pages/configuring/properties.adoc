== Configuration Properties for Apache Isis itself

.JDO/DataNucleus Objectstore Configuration Properties
[cols="2a,2a,2a", options="header"]

|`isis.persistor.` +
`datanucleus.` +
`standaloneCollection.` +
`bulkLoad`
|`true`, `false` +
(`false`)

Further xref:pjdo:ROOT:configuring.adoc#bulk-load[discussion below].

|`isis.persistor.` +

`classMetadataLoadedListener`
|fully qualified class name +
(`o.a.i.os.` +
`jdo.dn.` +
`CreateSchemaObject` +
`FromClassMetadata`)
|The default implementation creates a DB schema object.

There generally is no need to change this from its default.

|`isis.persistor.` +
`datanucleus.` +
`RegisterEntities.` +
`packagePrefix`
|fully qualified package names, CSV
|This property is derived automatically derived from the set of modules provided in the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/super.adoc#AppManifest[`AppManifest`], and so does not need to be specified explicitly.

It holds the set of packages to search so that DataNucleus builds its metamodel eagerly rather than lazily.
