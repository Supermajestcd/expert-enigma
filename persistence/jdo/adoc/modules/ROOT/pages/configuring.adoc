WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The xref:refguide:config:about.adoc[Configuration Guide] includes a xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.persistence.jdo-datanucleus.adoc[section] for JDO/Persistence object store, and another xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.persistence.jdo-datanucleus.impl.adoc[section] for configuration that is passed through to DataNucleus unchanged.

//WARNING: TODO - v2 - detail on original config properties (not yet reviewed) currently commented out.

//Apache Isis programmatically configures DataNucleus; any Apache Isis properties with the prefix `isis.persistence.jdo-datanucleus.impl` are passed through directly to the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore (with the prefix stripped off, of course).
//
//DataNucleus will for itself also and read the `META-INF/persistence.xml`; at a minimum this defines the name of the "persistence unit".
//In theory it could also hold mappings, though in Apache Isis we tend to use annotations instead.
//
//Furthermore, DataNucleus will search for various other XML mapping files, eg `mappings.jdo`.
//A full list can be found http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/metadata.html[here].
//The metadata in these XML can be used to override the annotations of annotated entities; see xref:userguide:btb:about.adoc#overriding-jdo-annotations[Overriding JDO Annotatons] for further discussion.
