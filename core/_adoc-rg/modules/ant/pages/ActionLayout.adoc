The table below summarizes the annotation's attributes.

.`@ActionLayout` attributes
[cols="2,2,4a", options="header"]
|===

| Attribute
| Values (default)
| Description


|xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/bookmarking.adoc[`bookmarking()`]
|`AS_ROOT`, `NEVER` +

For a domain service action to be contributed, the domain services must have a xref:rg:ant:DomainService/nature.adoc[nature] nature of either `VIEW` or `VIEW_CONTRIBUTIONS_ONLY`, and the action must have xref:rg:ant:Action/semantics.adoc[safe action semantics], and takes a single argument, namely the contributee domain object.


|xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/cssClass.adoc[`cssClass()`]
|Any string valid as a CSS class
|an additional CSS class around the HTML that represents for the action, to allow targetted styling in xref:rg:cfg:application-specific/application-css.adoc[`application.css`]. +

Supported by the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] but currently ignored by the xref:vro:ROOT::about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer].


|xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/cssClassFa.adoc[`cssClassFa()`]
|Any valid link:http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/[Font awesome] icon name
|specify a font awesome icon for the action's menu link or icon. +

|`EVERYWHERE`, `NOWHERE` +
(`NOWHERE`)
|indicates where (in the UI) the action should be hidden from the user.


|xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/named.adoc[`named()`]
|String.
|to override the name inferred from the action's name in code. +

A typical use case is if the desired name is a reserved Java keyword, such as `default` or `package`.

|xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/position.adoc[`position()`]
|`BELOW`, `RIGHT`, `PANEL`, `PANEL_DROPDOWN` (`BELOW`)
|for actions associated (using xref:rg:ant:MemberOrder.adoc[`@MemberOrder#named()`]) with properties, the positioning of the action's button with respect to the property

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItems {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)             // <1>
    @ActionLayout(
        bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT,
        cssClass="x-key",
        cssClassFa="fa-checkbox",
        describedAs="Mark the todo item as not complete after all",
        hidden=Where.NOWHERE                        // <2>
    )
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> required for bookmarkable actions
<2> default value, so could be omitted


[TIP]
====
As an alternative to using the `@ActionLayout` annotation, a xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] can be used (and is generally to be preferred since it is more flexible/powerful).
