// TODO: v2: replace @MemberOrder#name() with @PropertyLayout#group(); replace @MemberOrder#sequence() with @PropertyLayout#sequence().

The `@MemberOrder` annotation is used to specify the relative order of domain object members, that is: properties, collections and actions.
It works in conjunction with the xref:rg:ant:MemberGroupLayout.adoc[`@MemberGroupLayout`] annotation.


The annotation defines two attributes:

* xref:rg:ant:MemberOrder/name.adoc[`name()`]
* xref:rg:ant:MemberOrder/sequence.adoc[`sequence()`]

As this is an important topic, there is a xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc[separate chapter] that discussed object layout in full.


[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:rg:ant:Collection.adoc[`@Collection`], xref:rg:ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`], xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc[`@Property`]) and xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout.adoc[`@PropertyLayout`] that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.
 This is specifically so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
