The `@Property` annotation applies to properties collecting together all domain semantics within a single annotation.

It is also possible to apply the annotation to actions of domain services that are acting as contributed properties.



.`@Property` attributes
[cols="2,2,4a", options="header"]
|===

| Attribute
| Values (default)
| Description


|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#command[`command()`]
|`AS_CONFIGURED`, `ENABLED`, `DISABLED` +
(`AS_CONFIGURED`)
|whether the property edit should be reified into a `o.a.i.applib.` +
`services.command.Command` object through the xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`] service.


|`commandExecuteIn()`
|`FOREGROUND`,`BACKGROUND` +
(`FOREGROUND`)
|whether to execute the command immediately, or to persist it (assuming that an appropriate implementation of xref:rg:svc:application-layer-spi/CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] has been configured) such that a background scheduler can execute the command asynchronously


|`commandPersistence()`
|`PERSISTED`, `NOT_PERSISTED`, `IF_HINTED` +
(`PERSISTED`)
|whether the reified `Command` (as provided by the `CommandContext` domain service) should actually be persisted (assuming an appropriate implementation of xref:rg:svc:application-layer-spi/CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] has been configured).



|`commandDtoProcessor()`
|Implementation of `CommandDtoProcessor` interface +
(null)
|If the `Command` also implements `CommandWithDto` (meaning that it can return a `CommandDto`, in other words be converted into an XML memento), then optionally specifies a processor that can refine this XML.



|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#domainEvent[`domainEvent()`]
|subtype of `PropertyDomainEvent` +
(`PropertyDomainEvent.Default`)
|the event type to be posted to the xref:rg:svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] to broadcast the property's business rule checking (hide, disable, validate) and its modification (before and after).


|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#editing[`editing()`]
|`ENABLED`, `DISABLED`, `AS_CONFIGURED` +
(`AS_CONFIGURED`)
|whether a property can be modified or cleared from within the UI


|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#fileAccept[`fileAccept()`]
|Media type or file extension
|Hints the files to be uploaded to a xref:rg:cms:classes/value-types.adoc#Blob[`Blob`]
 or xref:rg:cms:classes/value-types.adoc#Clob[`Clob`]. +
 +
Note that this does not prevent the user from uploading some other file type; rather it merely defaults the file type in the file open dialog.


|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#hidden[`hidden()`]
|`EVERYWHERE`, `OBJECT_FORMS`, `PARENTED_TABLES`, `STANDALONE_TABLES`, `ALL_TABLES`, `NOWHERE` +
(`NOWHERE`)
|indicates where (in the UI) the property should be hidden from the user.


|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#maxLength[`maxLength()`]
|
|maximum number of characters for string parameters; ignored otherwise +

In many/most cases you should however use xref:rg:ant:Column.adoc[`@Column#length()`]


|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#mustSatisfy[`mustSatisfy()`]
|implementation of `o.a.i.applib.spec.Specification`
|allows arbitrary validation to be applied


|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#notPersisted[`notPersisted()`]
|`true`, `false` +
(`false`)
|whether to exclude from snapshots. +

[WARNING]
====
Property must also be annotated with `@javax.jdo.annotations.NotPersistent` in order to not be persisted.
====


|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#optionality[`optionality()`]
|
|specifies a property is optional rather than mandatory +

In many/most cases you should however use xref:rg:ant:Column.adoc[`@Column#allowsNull()`]



|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#projecting[`projecting()`]
|
|indicates that owning object is a view model that is acting as a projection of the underlying entity referenced by this property.



|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#publishing[`publishing()`]
|
|determines whether the editing of a property should be published.




|xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#regexPattern[`regexPattern()`]
|regular expression
|validates the contents of a string parameter against the regular expression pattern


|`regexPatternFlags()`
|value of flags as normally passed to `java.util.regex.` +
`Pattern#compile(...)`
|modifies the compilation of the regular expression


|===


For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class Customer {
    public static class EmailSpecification extends AbstractSpecification<String> {
        public String satisfiesSafely(String proposed) {
            return EmailUtil.ensureValidEmail(proposed);    // <1>
        }
    }
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true")                // <2>
    @Property(
        maxLength=30,
        mustSatisfy=EmailSpecification.class,
        regexPattern = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+",
        regexPatternFlags=Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE
    )
    public String getEmailAddress() { /* ... */ }
    public void setEmailAddress(String emailAddress) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
<1> the (fictitious) `EmailUtil.ensureValid(...)` (omitted for brevity) returns a string explaining if an email is invalid
<2> generally use instead of the `@Property#optionality()` attribute





[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:rg:ant:Collection.adoc[`@Collection`], xref:rg:ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`] and xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout.adoc[`@PropertyLayout`]) that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.  This is specifically
so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
