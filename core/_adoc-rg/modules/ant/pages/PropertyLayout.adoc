The `@PropertyLayout` annotation applies to properties collecting together all UI hints within a single annotation.


The table below summarizes the annotation's attributes.

.`@PropertyLayout` attributes
[cols="2,2,4a", options="header"]
|===

| Attribute
| Values (default)
| Description


|xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/cssClass.adoc[`cssClass()`]
|Any string valid as a CSS class
|the css class that a property should have, to allow more targetted styling in xref:rg:cfg:application-specific/application-css.adoc[`application.css`]


|xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/describedAs.adoc[`describedAs()`]
|String
|description of this property, eg to be rendered in a tooltip.

Defaults is `LEFT`, unless xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/multiLine.adoc[`multiLine`] in which case `TOP`.  The value `RIGHT` is only supported for boolean properties. +

It is also possible to change the default through a xref:rg:cfg:configuring-core.adoc#isis-viewers-propertyLayout-labelPosition[configuration property]


|xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/multiLine.adoc[`multiLine()`]
|Positive integer
|for string properties, render as a text area over multiple lines.  +

If set > 1, then xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/labelPosition.adoc[`labelPosition`] defaults to TOP.


|xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/named.adoc[`named()`]
|String
|to override the name inferred from the collection's name in code. +

A typical use case is if the desired name is a reserved Java keyword, such as `default` or `package`.

|how a property prompt should be displayed within the UI


|xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/renderedAsDayBefore.adoc[`renderedAsDayBefore()`]

|for date properties only, render the date as one day prior to the actually stored date.


|xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/typicalLength.adoc[`typicalLength()`]
|Positive integer.
|the typical entry length of a field, use to determine the optimum width for display

|xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/unchanging.adoc[`unchanging()`]

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @PropertyLayout(
        cssClass="x-key",
        named="Description of this <i>item</i>",
        namedEscaped=false,
        describedAs="What needs to be done",
        labelPosition=LabelPosition.LEFT,
        typicalLength=80
    )
    public String getDescription() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----

It is also possible to apply the annotation to actions of domain services that are acting as contributed properties.



[TIP]
====
As an alternative to using the `@PropertyLayout` annotation, a xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] can be used (and is generally to be preferred since it is more flexible/powerful).
====





[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:rg:ant:Collection.adoc[`@Collection`], xref:rg:ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`] and xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc[`@Property`]) that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.  This is specifically
so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
