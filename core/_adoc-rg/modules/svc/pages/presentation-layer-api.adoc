Domain service APIs for the presentation layer allow the domain objects to control aspects of the user interface.
The implementations are specific to the particular viewer (xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] or xref:vro:ROOT::about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer]) so the domain code must guard against them being unavailable in some cases.


The table below summarizes the presentation layer APIs defined by Apache Isis.
It also lists their corresponding implementation.
