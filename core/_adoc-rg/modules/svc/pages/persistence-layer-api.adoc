The persistence layer APIs provide domain objects with tools to manage the interactions with the persistence layer, for example adding on-the-fly caching to queries that are called many times within a loop.


The table below summarizes the persistence layer APIs defined by Apache Isis.
It also lists their corresponding implementation, either a default implementation provided by Apache Isis itself, or provided by one of the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] modules.
