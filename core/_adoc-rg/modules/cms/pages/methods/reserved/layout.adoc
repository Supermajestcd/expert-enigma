Every object has a xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc[layout] .
This may be specified using annotations such as xref:rg:ant:MemberOrder.adoc[`@MemberOrder`], xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc[`@DomainObjectLayout`] and the like,  but it much more commonly specified using an xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based .adoc[XML layout file].

The `layout` method allows the domain object to specify an alternate layout to its usual layout.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @Getter @Setter
    @PropertyLayout(hidden=ALWAYS)
    private String layout;

    public String layout() {                // <1>
        return layout;
    }

    @ActionLayout(
        redirect=EVEN_IF_SAME               // <2>
    )
    public Customer switchToEditMode() {
        setLayout("edit");
        return this;
    }
}
----
<1> specifies the alternate layout to use, eg `Customer-edit.layout.xml`.
<2> even though this action returns the same target object, still re-render the page.

If `switchToEditMode()` action is invoked, then the UI will attempt to render the customer using a `Customer.layout.edit.xml` layout file (instead of the default `Customer.layout.xml`).
