|Simply responsible for obtaining the current `AuthenticationSession` (the framework's internal representation of the currently logged-in user).

`CommandDtoServiceInternal`]
|Creates memento of current action invocation, for use as a serializable XML reified command.  The
most notable usage of this is to allow the execution of the `Command` to be deferred to run in the background (via
xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#commandExecuteIn()`] or
xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#command[`@Property#commandExecuteIn()`].

|xref:core:runtime-services:InteractionDtoServiceInternal.adoc[`o.a.i.c.m.s.ixn` +
`InteractionDtoServiceInternal`]
|Creates DTO for the current execution of an action invocation or property edit, for use either as a reified command or for implementations of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`].
