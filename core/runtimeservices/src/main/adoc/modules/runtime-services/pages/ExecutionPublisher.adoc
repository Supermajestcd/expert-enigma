WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The (internal) `ExecutionPublisher` domain service acts as an internal facade to any configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`ExecutionSubscriber`] domain service(s).

For published action invocations/ property edits, it provides an API for those member executions to call.

For published objects, it provides an API for the framework to call at the end of the interaction; it obtains details of the changed objects (from the xref:core:runtime-services:ChangedObjectsService.adoc[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`]) and filters them to just those objects that are to be published; these are then passed through to any configured `ExecutionSubscriber` implementations.


== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ExecutionPublisher {

	void publishActionInvocation(Execution execution);   // <1>

    void publishPropertyEdit(Execution execution);       // <2>

}
----
<1> to publish an action invocation, as represented by the specified member `Execution` parameter and with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#publishing[`@Action#executionPublishing`] annotation attribute or equivalent, to any configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`PublisherService`].
The `Execution` object will be an instance of `ActionInvocation` (see xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] for details).
<2> to publish a property edit, as as represented by the specified member `Execution` parameter and with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#publishing[`@Property#executionPublishing`] annotation attribute or equivalent, to any configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`PublisherService`].
The `Execution` object will be an instance of `PropertyEdit` (see xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] for details).
