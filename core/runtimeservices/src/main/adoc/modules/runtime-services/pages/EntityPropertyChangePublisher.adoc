WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The (internal) `EntityPropertyChangePublisher` service acts as an internal facade to any registered xref:refguide:applib-svc:EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber.adoc[`EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber`] service(s).
It is responsible for obtaining the details of all changes to domain objects within an interaction, and then to call the configured ``EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber``(s) to actually create audit entries of those changes.




== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface EntityPropertyChangePublisher {
    void publishEntityPropertyChanges(...);  // <1>
}
----
<1> uses the xref:core:runtime-services:ChangedObjectsService.adoc[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`] to obtain details of the changed properties, then call the configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`](s).

== Registering the Service

Apache Isis' default implementation of `EntityAuditDispatcher` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.
