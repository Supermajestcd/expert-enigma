WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The (internal) `PublisherDispatchService` domain service acts as an internal facade to any configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`] domain service(s).

For published action invocations/ property edits, it provides an API for those member executions to call.

For published objects, it provides an API for the framework to call at the end of the interaction; it obtains details of the changed objects (from the xref:core:runtime-services:ChangedObjectsService.adoc[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`]) and filters them to just those objects that are to be published; these are then passed through to any configured `PublisherService` implementations.


== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public class PublisherDispatchService {
    void publishAction(                             // <1>
            Interaction.Execution execution);
    void publishProperty(                           // <2>
            Interaction.Execution execution);
    void publishObjects();                          // <3>
}
----
<1> to publish an action invocation, as represented by the specified member `Execution` parameter and with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#publishing[`@Action#publishing`] annotation attribute or equivalent, to any configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`].
The `Execution` object will be an instance of `ActionInvocation` (see xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] for details).
<2> to publish a property edit, as as represented by the specified member `Execution` parameter and with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#publishing[`@Property#publishing`] annotation attribute or equivalent, to any configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`].
The `Execution` object will be an instance of `PropertyEdit` (see xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] for details).
<3> to publish all changed objects that are to be published (with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing`] annotation attribute or equivalent).


The service implementation is `o.a.i.c.m.s.publishing.PublisherDispatchService`.



== Registering the Service

Apache Isis' default implementation of `PublisherDispatchService` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use Spring's link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[`@Order`] annotation (as explained in the xref:refguide:applib-svc:about.adoc#overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).


== Related Classes

The service delegates between the (internal) xref:core:runtime-services:ChangedObjectsService.adoc[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`] domain service to the configured xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`].

The (internal) xref:core:runtime-services:AuditerDispatchService.adoc[`AuditerDispatchService`] performs a similar function for the xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`], also collating details of the changed objects from `ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`.
