| isis.reflector. +
explicit-annotations.action
| 
|  Whether or not a public method needs to be annotated with @{@link org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.Action} in order to be picked up as an action in the metamodel.

| isis.reflector.introspector. +
lock-after-full-introspection
|  true
|  If true, then no new specifications will be allowed to be loaded once introspection has been complete.  +
 Only applies if the introspector is configured to perform full introspection up-front (either because of {@link IntrospectionMode#FULL} or {@link IntrospectionMode#LAZY_UNLESS_PRODUCTION} when in production); otherwise is ignored. 

| isis.reflector.introspector. +
mode
| 
|  Whether all known types should be fully introspected as part of the bootstrapping, or should only be partially introspected initially.  +
 Leaving this as lazy means that there's a chance that metamodel validation errors will not be discovered during bootstrap.  That said, metamodel validation is still run incrementally for any classes introspected lazily after initial bootstrapping (unless {@link #isValidateIncrementally()} is disabled. 

| isis.reflector.introspector. +
parallelize
|  true
|  Whether to perform introspection in parallel.

| isis.reflector.introspector. +
validate-incrementally
|  true
|  If true, then metamodel validation is performed after any new specification has been loaded (after the initial bootstrapping).  +
 This does _not</i> apply if the introspector is configured to perform full introspection up-front AND when the metamodel is {@link #isLockAfterFullIntrospection() locked} after initial bootstrapping (because in that case the lock check will simply prevent any new specs from being loaded). But it will apply otherwise.   +
In particular, this setting _can</i> still apply even if the {@link #getMode() introspection mode} is set to {@link IntrospectionMode#FULL full}, because that in itself does not preclude some code from attempting to load some previously unknown type.  For example, a fixture script could attempt to invoke an action on some new type using the {@link org.apache.isis.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory} - this will cause introspection of that new type to be performed.
