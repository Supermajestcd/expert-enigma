[[datanucleus.cache.level2.mode]]
datanucleus.cache.level2.mode

| 
| Values of javax.persistence.SharedCacheMode, capitalized

Can be used to interface with external caching products. Use "none" to turn off L2 caching.

See also Cache docs for JDO, and for JPA

NOTE: this config property isn't used by the framework, but is provided as a convenience for IDE autocomplete.


|
[[datanucleus.connection-factory-name]]
datanucleus. +
connection-factory-name

| 
| The JNDI name for a connection factory for transactional connections.

For RBDMS, it must be a JNDI name that points to a javax.sql.DataSource object.

See also ``json`` (PascalCasing instead of kebab-casing).

NOTE: this config property isn't used by the framework, but is provided as a convenience for IDE autocomplete.


|
[[datanucleus.connection-factory2-name]]
datanucleus. +
connection-factory2-name

| 
| The JNDI name for a connection factory for non-transactional connections.

For RBDMS, it must be a JNDI name that points to a javax.sql.DataSource object.

See also ``json`` (PascalCasing instead of kebab-casing).

NOTE: this config property isn't used by the framework, but is provided as a convenience for IDE autocomplete.


|
[[datanucleus.connection-password-decrypter]]
datanucleus. +
connection-password-decrypter

| 
| Name of a class that implements ``DecryptionProvider`` and should only be specified if the password is encrypted in the persistence properties.

See also ``json`` (camelCasing instead of kebab-casing).

NOTE: this config property isn't used by the framework, but is provided as a convenience for IDE autocomplete.

|
[[datanucleus.persistence-unit-load-classes]]
datanucleus. +
persistence-unit-load-classes

|  true
| Used when we have specified the persistence-unit name for a PMF/EMF and where we want the datastore "tables" for all classes of that persistence-unit loading up into the StoreManager.

Defaults to true, which is the opposite of DataNucleus' own default. (The reason that DN defaults to false is because some databases are slow so such an operation would slow down the startup process).

See also ``json`` (camelCasing instead of kebab-casing).

NOTE: this config property isn't used by the framework, but is provided as a convenience for IDE autocomplete.


|
[[datanucleus.persistenceByReachabilityAtCommit]]

| 
| null


|
[[datanucleus.schema.auto-create-all]]
datanucleus.schema. +
auto-create-all

| 
| Whether DN should automatically create the database schema on bootstrapping.

This should be set to ``true`` when running against an in-memory database, but set to ``false`` when running against a persistent database (use something like flyway instead to manage schema evolution).

See also ``json`` (camelCasing instead of kebab-casing).

NOTE: this config property isn't used by the core framework, but is used by one the flyway extension.


|
[[datanucleus.schema.auto-create-database]]
datanucleus.schema. +
auto-create-database

| 
| Previously we defaulted this property to "true", but that could cause the target database to be modified
