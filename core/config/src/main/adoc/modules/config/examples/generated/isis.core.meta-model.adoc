filter-visibility
|  true
| Whether domain objects to which the current user does not have visibility access should be rendered within collections or drop-down choices/autocompletes.

One reason this filtering may be necessary is for multi-tenanted applications, whereby an end-user should only be able to "see" what data that they own. For efficiency, the application should only query for objects that the end-user owns. This configuration property acts as a safety net to prevent the end-user from viewing domain objects _even if_ those domain objects were rehydrated from the persistence store.
