lock-after-full-introspection
|  true
| If true, then no new specifications will be allowed to be loaded once introspection has been complete.

Only applies if the introspector is configured to perform full introspection up-front (either because of or \{@link IntrospectionMode#LAZY_UNLESS_PRODUCTION when in production); otherwise is ignored.

introspector.mode
| 
| Whether all known types should be fully introspected as part of the bootstrapping, or should only be partially introspected initially.

Leaving this as lazy means that there's a chance that metamodel validation errors will not be discovered during bootstrap. That said, metamodel validation is still run incrementally for any classes introspected lazily after initial bootstrapping (unless `#isValidateIncrementally()` is disabled.

introspector.parallelize
|  true
| Whether to perform introspection in parallel.


| isis.core.meta-model. +

validate-incrementally
|  true
| If true, then metamodel validation is performed after any new specification has been loaded (after the initial bootstrapping).

This does _not_ apply if the introspector is configured to perform full introspection up-front AND when the metamodel is locked after initial bootstrapping (because in that case the lock check will simply prevent any new specs from being loaded). But it will apply otherwise.

In particular, this setting _can_ still apply even if the introspection mode is set to full, because that in itself does not preclude some code from attempting to load some previously unknown type. For example, a fixture script could attempt to invoke an action on some new type using the `org.apache.isis.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory` - this will cause introspection of that new type to be performed.
