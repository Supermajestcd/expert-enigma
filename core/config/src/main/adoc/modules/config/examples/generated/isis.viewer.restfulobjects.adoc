base-uri
| 
| If left unset (the default), then the RO viewer will use the injected using @link javax.ws.rs.core.Context) to figure out the base Uri (used to render `href`s).

This will be correct much of the time, but will almost certainly be wrong if there is a reverse proxy.

If set, eg `https://dev.myapp.com/`, then this value will be used instead.

honor-ui-hints

| Whether to enable the `x-ro-follow-links` support, to minimize round trips.

The RO viewer provides the capability for the client to set the optional `x-ro-follow-links` query parameter, as described in section 34.4 of the RO spec v1.0. If used, the resultant representation includes the result of following the associated link, but through a server-side "join", somewhat akin to GraphQL.

By default this functionality is disabled, this configuration property enables the feature. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.

object-property-values-only
| 
| When rendering domain objects, if set the representation returned is stripped back to a minimal set, excluding links to actions and collections and with a simplified representation of an object's properties.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


| isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
strict-accept-checking
| 
| If set, then any unrecognised `Accept` headers will result in an HTTP _Not Acceptable_ response code (406).


| isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-described-by-links
| 
| If set, then the representations returned will omit any links to the formal domain-type representations.

suppress-member-disabled- +
reason
| 
| If set, then - should there be an interaction with an action, property or collection that is disabled - then this will prevent the `disabledReason` reason from being added to the returned representation.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


| isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-member-extensions
| 
| If set, then the `x-isis-format` key (under `extensions`) for properties will be suppressed.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


| isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-member-id
| 
| If set, then the `id` key for all members will be suppressed.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


| isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-member-links
| 
| If set, then the detail link (in other words `links[rel='details' ...]`) for all members will be suppressed.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


| isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-update-link
| 
| If set, then the update link (in other words `links[rel='update'... ]` to perform a bulk update of an object) will be suppressed.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.
