The `ClassDiscoveryService` service (and its various supertypes) is used to automatically discover subclasses of any given type on the classpath.
The primary use case is to support "convention-over-configuration" designs that work with a minimum of configuration.

This service is used by the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/super.adoc#FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`] service to automatically locate any xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/super.adoc#FixtureScript[`FixtureScript`] implementations.



== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ClassDiscoveryService  {
    @Programmatic
    <T> Set<Class<? extends T>> findSubTypesOfClasses(Class<T> type, String packagePrefix);
    @Deprecated
    @Programmatic
    <T> Set<Class<? extends T>> findSubTypesOfClasses(Class<T> type);       // <1>
}
----
<1> no longer used



== Implementation

Apache Isis provides an implementation of this service, namely `o.a.i.applib.services.classdiscovery.ClassDiscoveryServiceUsingReflections`.

[NOTE]
====
This implementation is also used to discover domain services annotated with xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainService.adoc[`@DomainService`].
Currently this logic uses the implementation directly, so is not pluggable.
====

To use an alternative implementation, implement the `ClassDiscoveryService` interface and use xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainServiceLayout.adoc#menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained in the xref:refguide:applib-svc:intro/overriding-the-services.adoc[introduction] to this guide).





== Related Services

The xref:refguide:applib-svc:testing/FixtureScripts.adoc[`FixtureScripts`] domain service uses `ClassDiscoveryService` to discover ``FixtureScript``s implementations to present in the UI.

Note that the bootstrapping of the framework itself does _not_ use this service (though it does use the same underlying library as the default implementation of this service, namely `org.reflections.Reflections`).
