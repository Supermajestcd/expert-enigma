The `describedAs()` attribute is used to provide a short description of the view model to the user; in the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'.

This attribute is the same as xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#describedAs[`@DomainObjectLayout#describedAs()`], but for view models instead of entities.
