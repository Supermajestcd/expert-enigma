Mothballed Components
===========

These components are no longer being actively worked on (there have been no releases of them since Isis graduated as an Apache top-level project.

Instead of the HTML viewer, we suggest you use the Wicket viewer or the Scimpi viewer.

Instead of the SQL or LDAP security implementations, we suggest you use the Shiro security integration.
