/**
 * Indicates that the class has value semantics.
 *
 * <p>
 * By &quot;value semantics&quot; all we actually mean that the class is
 * aggregated (or embedded) and so therefore (conceptually) is not shared between
 * instances of classes. However, values very often have other semantics, and so
 * this annotation allows these to also be specified:
 * <li>it may be parseable</li>
 * <li>it may be encodeable</li>
 * <li>it may be immutable, and by default is presumed that it is</li>
 * <li>it may follow the equal-by-content contract (as per
 * {@link EqualByContent}), and by default is presumed that it does.</i> </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note also that though a value is conceptually not shared, if it is also
 * immutable then it is in fact safe to share objects (as in
 * the flyweight pattern). In addition, the {@link EqualByContent} semantic
 * means that we needn't care whether value types are being shared or not.
 *
 * @since 1.x {@index}
 * @see EqualByContent
 *
 * <p>
 *     Note: This annotation is only incompletely recognized by the framework, and may be deprecated in the future.

     * the result of discards the instantiated object. What that means in
     * particular is that a self-encoding class shouldn't encode its own state,
     * it should encode the state of the object passed to it.
