/**
 * For use by repository implementations, representing the values of a query.

 * <p>
 * The implementations of these objects are be provided by the underlying
 * persistor/object store; consult its documentation.
 * <p>
 * Implementations are expected to implement the {@link #getStart()} and
 * {@link #getCount()} methods, which are used to support range / paging
 * the data. Returned result sets are expected to start from index "start",
 * and no more than "count" items are expected.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> that not every object store will necessarily support this
 * interface. In particular, the in-memory object store does not. For this, you
 * can use the {@link Predicate} interface to similar effect, for example in
 * {@link RepositoryService#allMatches(Class, Predicate, long, long)}).
 *
 * Note that the predicate is applied within the {@link RepositoryService}
 * (ie client-side) rather than being pushed back to the object store.
