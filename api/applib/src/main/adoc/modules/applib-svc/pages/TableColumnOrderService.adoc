WARNING: TODO - to review for v2.


The `TableColumnOrderService` provides the ability to reorder (or suppress) columns in both parented- and standalone tables.


== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/tablecol/TableColumnOrderService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> for the parent collection owned by the specified parent and collection Id, return the set of property ids in the same or other order.
<.> for the standalone collection of the specified type, return the set of property ids in the same or other order, else return `null` if provides no reordering.

There can be multiple implementations of `TableColumnOrderService` registered, ordered as per the Spring link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[`@Order`] annotation (or equivalent).
The ordering provided by the first such service that returns a non-`null` value will be used.
If all provided implementations return `null`, then the framework will fallback to a default implementation.



== Implementation

The framework provides a fallback implementation of this service, namely `TableColumnOrderService.Default`.

There can be multiple implementations of `TableColumnOrderService registered.
These are checked in turn (chain of responsibility pattern), ordered according to the Spring link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[`Order`] annotation, or equivalent (as explained in the xref:refguide:applib-svc:about.adoc#overriding-the-services.adoc[introduction] to this guide).
The order from the first service that returns a non null value will be used.
