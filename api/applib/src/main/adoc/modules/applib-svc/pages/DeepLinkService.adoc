WARNING: TODO - to review for v2.


The `DeepLinkService` provides the ability to obtain a `java.net.URI` that links to a representation of any (persisted) domain entity or view model.

A typical use case is to generate a clickable link for rendering in an email, PDF, tweet or other communication.



== API

The API defined by `DeepLinkService` is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/linking/DeepLinkService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<1> Creates a URI that can be used to obtain a representation of the provided domain object in one of the Apache Isis viewers.


== Implementation

The xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] provides an implementation of this service `o.a.i.viewer.wicket.viewer.services.DeepLinkServiceWicket`.

There is no domain service to support deep links to the URLs of the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer].
However, a URL can be constructed easily enough according to the link:http://www.restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] in conjunction with a `Bookmark` obtained via the xref:refguide:applib-svc:BookmarkService.adoc[`BookmarkService`].


== Usage within the framework

The xref:refguide:applib-svc:EmailNotificationService.adoc[`EmailNotificationService`] uses this service in order to generate emails as part of xref:vw:ROOT:features.adoc#user-registration[user registration].
