The `TranslationsResolver` domain service locates and return translations.

It is one of the supporting services that work together to implement Apache Isis' support for i18n, being used by Isis' default implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:TranslationService.adoc[`TranslationService`].

For the "big picture" and further details on Apache Isis' i18n support, see xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[here].



== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/i18n/TranslationsResolver.java[tags="refguide"]
----



== Implementation

Isis' xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] provides an implementation of this service (`TranslationsResolverWicket`) which leverages Apache Wicket APIs.  This searches for translation files in the standard `WEB-INF/` directory.

There is no equivalent implementation for the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer].




== Related Services


This service works in conjunction with xref:refguide:applib-svc:LocaleProvider.adoc[`LocaleProvider`] and xref:refguide:applib-svc:TranslationService.adoc[`TranslationService`] in order to provide i18n support.
