WARNING: TODO - to review for v2.


The `GridLoaderService` provides the ability to load the XML layout (grid) for a domain class.

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/grid/GridLoaderService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> whether dynamic reloading of layouts is enabled.  The default implementation enables reloading for prototyping, disables in production
<.> support metamodel invalidation/rebuilding of spec, eg as called by this xref:refguide:applib-cm:rgcms.adoc#__rgcms_classes_mixins_Object_rebuildMetamodel[Object mixin] action.
<.> whether any persisted layout metadata (eg a `.layout.xml` file) exists for this domain class.
<.> returns a new instance of a xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/layout.adoc#component[`Grid`] for the specified domain class, eg as loaded from a `layout.xml` file.
If none exists, will return null (and the calling xref:refguide:applib-svc:GridService.adoc[`GridService`] will use xref:refguide:applib-svc:GridSystemService.adoc[`GridSystemService`] to obtain a default grid for the domain class).
<.> Load a specific layout alternative, eg if specified through a `layout()` supporting method of the domain object itself.

== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation of this service, namely `GridLoaderServiceDefault`.  This implementation
loads the grid from its serialized representation as a `.layout.xml` file, loaded from the classpath.

For example, the layout for a domain class `com.mycompany.myapp.Customer` would be loaded from `com/mycompany/myapp/Customer.layout.xml`.
