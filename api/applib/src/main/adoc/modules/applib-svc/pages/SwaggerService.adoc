WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The `SwaggerService` generates link:http://swagger.io/[Swagger] spec files to describe the public and/or private RESTful APIs exposed by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer].

These spec files can then be used with the link:http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI] page to explore the REST API, or used to generate client-side stubs using the link:http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/[Swagger codegen] tool, eg for use in a custom REST client app.

[NOTE]
====
Not all of the REST API exposed by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer] is included in the Swagger schema definition files; the emphasis is those REST resources that are used to develop custom apps: domain objects, domain object collections and action invocations.
When combined with Apache Isis' own xref:vro:ROOT:simplified-representations.adoc[simplified representations], these are pretty much all that is needed  for this use case.

== API

The API defined by `SwaggerService` is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/swagger/SwaggerService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> Generate a Swagger spec with the specified visibility and format (discussed below).

<.> Produces a limited spec for use by third-party clients, ie public use.
This specification is restricted only to
xref:userguide:fun:overview.adoc#view-models[view model]s and to domain services with a xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainService.adoc#nature[nature] of `VIEW_REST_ONLY`.
<.> Produces a more complete spec, for internally-managed clients, ie private internal use.
This specification includes domain entities and all menu domain services (as well as any view models).
<.> Ditto, but also including any xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#restrictTo[prototype] actions.

<.> Generate as JSON...
<.> \... or as YAML.



== Implementation

Apache Isis provides a default implementation of the service, `o.a.i.core.metamodel.services.swagger.SwaggerServiceDefault`.



== Usage within the framework

This service is provided as a convenience for applications, it is not (currently) used by the framework itself.




== Related Services

A `SwaggerServiceMenu` domain service (part of the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer]) provides a prototype action that enables the swagger spec to be downloaded from theUI.

// FIXME: currently removed in v2, may reinstate
//Apache Isis' xref:refguide:mvn:about.adoc[Maven plugin] also provides a xref:refguide:mvn:swagger.adoc[swagger goal] which allows the spec file(s) to be generated at build time.
//This then allows client-side stubs can then be generated in turn as part of a build pipeline.
