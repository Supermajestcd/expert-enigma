// TODO: this is an SPI, so maybe restfulobjects should define an "spi" module for this.

The `ContentMappingService` supports the (default implementation of the) internal xref:core:runtime-services:ContentNegotiationService.adoc[`ContentNegotiationService`] SPI enabling the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] to represent domain objects in some other format as specified by the HTTP `Accept` header.

For its part, the (default implementation of the) `ContentNegotiationService` will check _all_ available implementations of `ContentMappingService` to convert the domain object to the requested media type, rather than merely the first implementation found; in other words it uses the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern[chain-of-responsibility] pattern.
Services are checked in the ordering defined by the Spring link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[`@Order`] annotation.
The mapped object used will be the first non-`null` result returned by an implementation.



== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/conmap/ContentMappingService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> typically the input is a domain object (whose structure might change over time), and the output is a DTO (whose structure is guaranteed to be preserved over time)
<.> as per the caller's HTTP `Accept` header




== Implementations

The framework provides two implementations of this service, both to allow objects implementing `HasCommandDto` to be converted into serializable ``CommandDto``s, in other words XML.
This is used by the xref:extensions:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] and xref:extensions:command-replay:about.adoc[Command Replay] extensions to allow commands to be replicated from a primary to secondary system, for regression testing.

The implementations are:

* `o.a.i.applib.services.commanddto.conmap.ContentMappingServiceForCommandDto` will map any single instance of a `HasCommandDto` into a `CommandDto` XML document
* `o.a.i.applib.services.commanddto.conmap.ContentMappingServiceForCommandsDto` will map a list of ``HasCommandDto``s into a `CommandsDto` XML document, and will wrap any single instance of a `CommandWithDto` into a singleton list and thence into a `CommandsDto` XML document.

If the action invocation or property edit represent provides an implementation of a `CommandDtoProcessor` (by way of xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#commandDtoProcessor()`] or xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#command[`@Property#commandDtoProcessor()`]) then this is also called to post-process the persisted `CommandDto` if required.
A typical use case for this is to dynamically add in serialized ``Blob``s or ``Clob``s, the values of which are not captured by default in `CommandDto`.

To support the writing of custom implementations of this interface, the framework also provides `ContentMappingService.Util` which includes a couple of convenience utilities:

[source,java]
----
public static class Util {
    public static String determineDomainType(
        final List<MediaType> acceptableMediaTypes) { /* ... */ }
    public static boolean isSupported(
            final Class<?> clazz,
            final List<MediaType> acceptableMediaTypes) { /* ... */ }
}
----




== Related Services

This service is a companion to the default implementation of the xref:core:runtime-services:ContentNegotiationService.adoc[`ContentNegotiationService`].

The framework implementations of `ContentMappingService` use the xref:refguide:applib-svc:MetamodelService.adoc[`MetaModelService`] to lookup any custom implementations of `CommandDtoProcessor`.
