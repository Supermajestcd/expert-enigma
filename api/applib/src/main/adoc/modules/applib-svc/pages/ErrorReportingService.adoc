`ErrorReportingService` is an optional SPI that provides the ability to record any errors/exceptions that might occur in the application into an external incident recording system (such as JIRA or Slack).

The `ErrorDetails` object returned by this service contains a number of elements;

* a user-friendly (jargon-free) error message to be returned and rendered to the end-user
* an optional incident reference (eg a JIRA issue `XXX-1234`).
* a URL for an external image.
+
For example, this could be to a comic strip or (as a bit of fun) a picture of a random kitten.

The information in this object is used by the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket Viewer], rendered whenever an error occurs.



== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/error/ErrorReportingService.java[tags="refguide"]
----

where `ErrorDetails` provided to the service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/error/ErrorDetails.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> the main message to be displayed to the end-user.
The service is responsible for translating this into the language of the end-user (it can use xref:refguide:applib-svc:LocaleProvider.adoc[`LocaleProvider`] if required).
<.> whether this message has already been recognized by an xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExceptionRecognizerService.adoc[`ExceptionRecognizer`] service.
Generally this converts potentially non-recoverable (fatal) exceptions into recoverable exceptions (warnings) as well providing an alternative mechanism for generating user-friendly error messages.
<.> whether the cause of the exception was due to a lack of privileges.
In such cases the UI restricts the information shown to the end-user, to avoid leaking potentially sensitive information
<.> the stack trace of the exception, including the trace of any exceptions in the causal chain.
These technical details are hidden from the user and only shown for non-recoverable exceptions.


and `Ticket` (returned by the service) is an interface:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/error/Ticket.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> is a unique identifier that the end-user can use to track any follow-up from this error.
For example, an implementation might automatically log an issue in a bug tracking system such as JIRA, in which case the reference would
probably be the JIRA issue number <tt>XXX-1234</tt>.

<.> a short, jargon-free message to display to the end-user.

<.> is optional additional details to show.
For example, these might include text on how to recover from the error, or workarounds, or just further details on contacting the help desk if the issue is severe and requires immediate attention.

<.> is optional, specifying whether to show a button to view details of the stack trace.
By default a stack trace button is not shown if a ticket is returned (but _is_ shown if there is no `ErrorReportingService` configured, or if it returns no ticket).

<.> returns a Html representation of this ticket.




== Implementation

There is no default implementation of this service, but there are a couple of concrete examples of `Ticket` in `core-runtime`.

The xref:docs:demo:about.adoc[demo app] provides an example implementation:

[source,java]
----
include::docs:demo:example$error/service/DemoErrorReportingService.java[tags="refguide"]
----

which is rendered as:
