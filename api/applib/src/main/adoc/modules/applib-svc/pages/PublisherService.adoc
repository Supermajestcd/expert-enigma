WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The `PublisherService` API is intended for coarse-grained publish/subscribe for system-to-system interactions, from Apache Isis to some other system.
Events that can be published are action invocations/property edits, and changed objects.
A typical use case is to publish onto a pub/sub bus such as link:http://activemq.apache.org/[ActiveMQ] with link:http://camel.apache.org[Camel] to keep other systems up to date.

An alternative use is for profiling: for each execution (action invocation/property edit) the framework captures metrics of the number of objects loaded or dirtied as the result of that execution.
If the xref:refguide:applib-svc:WrapperFactory.adoc[`WrapperFactory`] is used to call other objects then the metrics are captured for each sub-execution.
The framework provides a default implementation, `PublisherServiceLogging`, that will log these execution graphs (in XML form, per the xref:refguide:schema:ixn.adoc["ixn" schema]) to an SLF4J logger.

Only actions/properties/domain objects annotated for publishing (using xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#publishing[`@Action#publishing()`], xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#publishing[`@Property#publishing()`] or xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`]) are published.


== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/publish/PublisherService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> to publish an individual action invocation or property edit, as captured within an `Interaction.Execution`.
<.> to publish a set of changed objects.

where `PublishedObjects` is provides statistics on the interaction execution (action invocation or property edit):

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/publish/PublishedObjects.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> inherited from `HasUniqueId`, correlates back to the unique identifier of the transaction in which these objects were changed.
<.> inherited from `HasUsername`, is the user that initiated the transaction causing these objects to change
<.> Time that the interaction execution completed
<.> Number of domain objects loaded in this interaction
<.> Number of domain objects created in this interaction
<.> Number of domain objects updated in this interaction
<.> Number of domain objects deleted in this interaction
<.> Number of domain objects properties that were changed in this interaction
<.> Same details, as per xref:refguide:schema:chg.adoc[`chg.xsd`] schema.
This can be converted into a serializable XML representation using the `ChangesDtoUtils` utility class.

The numbers of objects loaded, created, updated or deleted and the number of object properties modified (in other words the "size" or "weight" of the transaction).

Each `Interaction.Execution` has an owning `Interaction`; this is the same object obtainable from xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`].
Implementations that publish member executions can use `Interaction.Execution#getDto()` method to return a DTO (as per the xref:refguide:schema:ixn.adoc["ixn" schema]) which can be converted into a serializable XML representation using the `InteractionDtoUtils` utility class.
The XML can either serialize a single execution, or can be a "deep" serialization of an execution and all sub-executions.



== Implementations

The framework allows multiple implementations of this service to be registered; all will be called.

There are two implementations provided by the framework:

* The core framework provides one implementation of its own, `PublisherServiceLogging` (in `o.a.i.applib.services.publish` package).
This logs serializations to a link:https://logging.apache.org/log4j/log4j-2.2/manual/configuration.html[Log4j2] logger
+
[source,xml]
.log4j2-spring.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN">
  <Properties> ... </Properties>
  <Appenders> ... </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    ...
    <logger
      name="org.apache.isis.applib.services.publish.PublisherServiceLogging"
      level="debug"/>
    ...
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
----
+
See the `log4j2-spring.xml` file in xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[simpleapp] for the omitted detail.

* the xref:mappings:outbox-publisher:about.adoc[Outbox Publisher] in the xref:mappings:ROOT:about.adoc[Mappings catalog] persists each interaction into a link:https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html[outbox table] for subsequent processing.
As its name implies, it uses xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] to do this.
+
WARNING: TODO: v2 - need to migrate this across.
Also, check the name is correct.




== Usage

To indicate that:

* an action invocation should be published, annotate it with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#publishing[`@Action#publishing()`] annotation.
* an property edit should be published, annotate it with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#publishing[`@Property#publishing()`] annotation.
* a changed object should be published is to annotate it with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`] annotation.

The module also provide services that contribute to the UI.
If contributions are not required in the UI, these can be suppressed either using security or by implementing a xref:userguide:btb:about.adoc#vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].







== Related Services

This service supports two main use cases:

* coarse-grained publish/subscribe for system-to-system interactions, from Apache Isis to some other system.

* profiling of interactions/transactions, eg to diagnose response/throughput issues.


To support these use cases several other services are involved:

* the xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] is used to obtain the `Interaction` from which the member executions are published.

* the (internal) xref:core:runtime-services:ChangedObjectsService.adoc[`ChangedObjectsService`] domain service is used to obtain the set of objects modified throughout the transaction

* the (internal) xref:core:runtime-services:PublisherDispatchService.adoc[`PublisherDispatchService`] domain service filters these down to those changed objects that are also published (as per xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`]) and delegates to the `PublisherService`.

* the xref:refguide:applib-svc:MetricsService.adoc[`MetricsService`] is used to obtain the objects that are loaded throughout the transaction; this info is used in order to instantiate the `PublishedObjects` object passed through to the `PublisherService`.


The services provided by this module combine very well with the xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] and with xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`].
The `CommandService` captures the __cause__ of an interaction (an action was invoked, a property was edited), while the `PublisherService` captures the __effect__ of that interaction in terms of events, and the `AuditerService` captures the effect of the interaction in terms of changed state.
You may also want to configure the xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`], which also captures the effect of the interaction but as an event.
All three of these services collaborate implicitly by way of the xref:applib-classes:classes/mixins.adoc#HasUniqueId[`HasUniqueId`] interface.

The xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] differs from the `PublisherService` in that it is intended for fine-grained publish/subscribe for object-to-object interactions within an Apache Isis domain object model.
The event propagation is strictly in-memory, and there are no restrictions on the object acting as the event; it need not be serializable, for example.
That said, it is possible to obtain a serialization of the action invocation/property edit causing the current event to be raised using xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] domain service.
