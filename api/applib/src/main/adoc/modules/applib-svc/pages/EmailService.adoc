The `EmailService` provides the ability to send HTML emails, with attachments, to one or more recipients.

Apache Isis provides a default implementation to send emails (as an HTML message) using an external SMTP provider.

== API

The API for the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface EmailService {
    boolean send(                                                   // <.>
        List<String> to, List<String> cc, List<String> bcc,         // <.>
        String subject,
        String body,                                                // <.>
        DataSource... attachments);
    boolean isConfigured();                                         // <.>
}
----
<.> is the main API to send the email (and optional attachments).
Will return `false` if failed to send
<.> pass either `null` or `Collections.emptyList()` if not required
<.> should be HTML text
<.> indicates whether the implementation was configured and initialized correctly.
If this returns `false` then any attempt to call `send(...)` will fail.

== Implementation

As noted in the introduction, the core framework provides a default implementation, `EmailServiceDefault`.
This sends email as an HTML message, using an external SMTP provider.

=== Configuration Properties

The default implementation defines a number of xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.core.runtime-services.adoc[configuration properties], under the `isis.core.runtime-services.email` key.


=== Alternatives

If you wish to write an alternative implementation, be aware that it should process the message body as HTML (as opposed to plain text or any other format).


== Related Services

The email service is used by the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EmailNotificationService.adoc[`EmailNotificationService`] which is, in turn, used by xref:refguide:applib-svc:UserRegistrationService.adoc[`UserRegistrationService`].
