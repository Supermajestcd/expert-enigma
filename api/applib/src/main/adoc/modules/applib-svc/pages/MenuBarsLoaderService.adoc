The `MenuBarsLoaderService` is used by the default implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:MenuBarsService.adoc[MenuBarsService] to return a a xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/menubars.adoc[`MenuBars`] instance deserialized from the `menubars.layout.xml` file read from the classpath.

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/menu/MenuBarsLoaderService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> Whether dynamic reloading of the menu bars layout is enabled.
If not, then the xref:refguide:applib-svc:MenuBarsService.adoc[MenuBarsService] will cache the layout once loaded.
<.> Returns a new instance of `MenuBars` if possible, otherwise null.

== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation of this service, namely `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.menu.MenuBarsLayoutServiceDefault`.

This searches for a file resource `menubars.layout.xml`, expected to reside in the same package as the `AppManifest` used to bootstrap the application.

It supports reloading only in prototype mode.
