The `MetricsService` is an xref:refguide:applib-ant:IsisSessionScope.adoc[`IsisSessionScope`]d domain service that hooks into the JDO/DataNucleus ObjectStore to provide a number of counters relating to numbers of object loaded, dirtied etc.

The service is used by the xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] domain service (to populate the DTO held by the `Interaction.Execution`) and also by the (internal) xref:core:runtime-services:PublisherDispatchService.adoc[`PublisherDispatchService`] domain service (to populate the `PublishedObjects` class.


== API

The API of the service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/metrics/MetricsService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> The number of objects that have, so far in this request, been loaded from the database.
<.> The number of objects that have, so far in this request, been dirtied/will need updating in the database); a good measure of the footprint of the interaction.


== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation of this API, namely `o.a.i.c.r.s.metrics.MetricsServiceDefault`.



== Related Services

The xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`] also captures the metrics gathered by the `MetricsService` and publishes them as part of the `PublishedObjects` class (part of its SPI).
