The `JaxbService` allows instances of JAXB-annotated classes to be marshalled to XML and unmarshalled from XML back into domain objects.

== API

The API defined by `JaxbService` is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/jaxb/JaxbService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> unmarshalls the XML into an instance of the class, using a preconfigured JAXB
<.> ditto, but providing properties to the JAXB unmarshaller.
Discussed further below.
<.> unmarshalls the XML to the specified domain class
<.> ditto, but providing properties to the JAXB unmarshaller.
<.> marshalls the domain object into XML
<.> ditto, but providing properties to the JAXB unmarshaller.
<.> generates a map of each of the schemas referenced; the key is the schema namespace, the value is the XML of the schema itself.
This can either include or exclude the Isis schemas in the generated map.

With respect to the `IsisSchemas` enum: a JAXB-annotated domain object will live in its own XSD namespace and may reference multiple other XSD schemas.
In particular, many JAXB domain objects will reference the
xref:refguide:schema:about.adoc[common Isis schemas] (for example the `OidDto` class that represents a reference to a persistent entity).
The enum indicates whether these schemas should be included or excluded from the map.

== Implementation

Apache Isis provides a default implementation of the service, `o.a.i.applib.services.jaxb.JaxbServiceDefault`.

== Usage within the framework

This service is provided as a convenience for applications, but is also used internally by the framework to marshall xref:refguide:applib-ant:XmlRootElement.adoc[`@XmlRootElement`]-annotated
xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#view-models[view models].
The functionality to download XML and XSD schemas is also exposed in the UI through mixins of the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/mixins.adoc#Dto[`Dto`] interface.
