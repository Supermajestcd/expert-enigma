WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The `ServiceRegistry` domain service (and its various supertypes)collects together methods for injecting or looking up domain services (either provided by the framework or application-specific) currently known to the runtime.



== API

The API of `ServiceRegistry` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ServiceRegistry {
	<T> Optional<T> lookupService(Class<T> serviceClass);      // <.>
	<T> T lookupServiceElseFail(Class<T> serviceClass);        // <.>
	<T> Can<T> select(Class<T> type);                          // <.>
	<T> Can<T> select(Class<T> type, Annotation[] qualifiers); // <.>
}
----
<.> optionally returns the first registered service that implements the specified class
<.> returns the first registered service that implements the specified class, else throws an exception
<.> returns all registered services that implement the specified type
<.> returns all registered services that implement the specified type, considering given qualifiers

Service injection is done automatically if objects are created using the
xref:refguide:applib-svc:FactoryService.adoc[`FactoryService`].



== Usage

The primary use case is to lookup domain services programmatically (as an alternative to injection).

For example:

.Service Lookup (Optional)
[source,java]
----
Optional<MyService> myServiceIfAny = serviceRegistry.lookupService(MyService.class);
----

.Service Lookup (enforced non-null)
[source,java]
----
MyService myService = serviceRegistry.lookupServiceElseFail(MyService.class);
----


== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.registry.ServiceRegistryDefault`).


== Related Services

See xref:refguide:applib-svc:ServiceInjector.adoc[`ServiceInjector`] to inject domain services rather than just look them up.
