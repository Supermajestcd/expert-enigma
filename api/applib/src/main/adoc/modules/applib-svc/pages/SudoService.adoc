WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The `SudoService` allows the current user reported by the xref:refguide:applib-svc:UserService.adoc[`UserService`]  to be temporarily changed to some other user.
This is useful both for xref:testing:integtestsupport:about.adoc[integration testing] (eg if testing a workflow system whereby objects are moved from one user to another) and while running xref:fixtures:ROOT:about.adoc[fixture scripts] (eg setting up objects that would normally require several users to have acted upon the objects).


== API

The API provided by the service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/sudo/SudoService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> special role which, if granted, will in effect disable security.
See xref:#access_all_role[below] for more details.
<.> executes the `Runnable` block of code in a way that calls to xref:UserService.adoc[`UserService`]'s `getUser()` will return the specified user.
The roles of the current user are preserved.
<.> ditto, but executes a `Callable`
<.> executes the `Runnable` block of code in a way that calls to `UserService#getUser()` will return the specified user.
The effective roles returned are those specified.
<.> ditto, but executes a `Callable`

The current user/role reported by the internal xref:core:runtime-services:AuthenticationSessionProvider.adoc[`AuthenticationSessionProvider`] will also return the specified user/roles.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that this the "effective user" does not propagate through to the xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[Shiro security mechanism], which will continue to be evaluated according to the permissions of the current user.
See the xref:refguide:applib-svc:SudoService.adoc#access_all_role[`ACCESS-ALL-ROLE`] below for details of how to circumvent this.

== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.sudo.SudoServiceDefault`).



== Usage

For example, this fixture script uses the `SudoService` to set up `ToDoItem` objects:

[source,java]
----
protected void execute(final ExecutionContext ec) {
    ...
    sudoService.sudo(getUsername(),
            new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    wrap(toDoItem).completed();
                }
            });
    ...
}
----


[#access_all_role]
=== ACCESS_ALL_ROLE

When `sudo(...)` is called the "effective user" is reported by both xref:refguide:applib-svc:UserService.adoc[`UserService`] and by xref:core:runtime-services:AuthenticationSessionProvider.adoc[`AuthenticationSessionProvider`], but does not propagate through to the xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[Shiro security mechanism].
These continue to be evaluated according to the permissions of the current user.

This can be a problem in certain use cases.
For example if running a fixture script (which uses the xref:refguide:applib-svc:WrapperFactory.adoc[`WrapperFactory`]) from within an implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:UserRegistrationService.adoc[`UserRegistrationService`], this is likely to result in ``HiddenException``s being thrown because there is no effective user.

In such cases, permission checking can simply be disabled by specifying `SudoService.ACCESS_ALL_ROLE` as one of the roles.
For example:

[source,java]
----
protected void execute(final ExecutionContext ec) {
    ...
    sudoService.sudo(getUsername(), Arrays.asList(SudoService.ACCESS_ALL_ROLE),
            new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    wrap(toDoItem).completed();
                }
            });
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
In the future this service may be used more deeply, eg to propagate permissions through to the Shiro security mechanism also.

== SPI

The `SudoService.Spi` service allows implementations of `SudoService` to notify other services/components that the effective user and roles are different.
The default implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:UserService.adoc[`UserService`] has been refactored to leverage this SPI.

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/sudo/SudoService.java[tags="refguide-1",indent=0]
----
<1> Called by `SudoService#sudo(...)`, prior to invoking its `Runnable` or `Callable`.
<2> Called by `SudoService#sudo(...)`, after its `Runnable` or `Callable` has been invoked.

The names of these methods were chosen based on link:https://shiro.apache.org/static/1.2.6/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/subject/Subject.html#runAs-org.apache.shiro.subject.PrincipalCollection-[similar names within Shiro].

The `IsisSessionFactory` is a lower-level framework service.
It provides the `IsisSessionFactory#runAuthenticated(...)` method as a way to programmatically start a new `IsisSession` (these can be nested).
