The `MetaModelService` service provides access to a number of aspects of Apache Isis' internal metamodel.


== API


The API defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/metamodel/MetaModelService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> reverse lookup of a domain class' object type
<.> lookup of a domain class' object type
<.> invalidate and rebuild the internal metadata for the specified domain type.
<.> returns a structure representing all the known types held in the domain model.
Further details below.
<.> what sort of object a domain type is represents:
+
accepting:
+
[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/metamodel/MetaModelService.java[tags="refguide-1",indent=0]
----
+
and returning:
+
[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/metamodel/BeanSort.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> what sort of object the domain type inferred from a bookmark represents
<.> obtain an implementation of `CommandDtoProcessor` (if any) as per an xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#commandDtoProcessor()`] or xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#command[`@Property#commandDtoProcessor()`].
+
This is used by the xref:refguide:applib-svc:ContentMappingService.adoc#implementations[framework-provided implementations] of `ContentMappingService`.
<.> Exports the entire metamodel as a DTO, serializable into XML using JAXB.
Discussed further below.

The `DomainModel` is simply:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/metamodel/DomainModel.java[tags="refguide"]
----

where `DomainMember` in turn is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/metamodel/DomainMember.java[tags="refguide"]
----

For the `exportMetaModel()` method, the `Config` property specifies which package(s) to include and can be used to ignore certain elements:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/metamodel/MetaModelService.java[tags="refguide-2",indent=0]
----



== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation of this service, `o.a.i.c.m.services.metamodel.MetaModelServiceDefault`.


== Related Services

The `MetaModelServiceMenu` provides a method to download all domain members as a CSV (by calling `MetaModelService#export()`) or as an XML (by calling `MetaModelService6#exportMetaModel(...)`.
