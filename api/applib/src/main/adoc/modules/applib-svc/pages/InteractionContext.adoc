WARNING: TODO - to review for v2.


The `InteractionContext` is a request-scoped domain service that is used to obtain the current
`Interaction`.

An `Interaction` generally consists of a single top-level `Execution`, either to invoke an action or to edit a property.
If that top-level action or property uses xref:refguide:applib-svc:WrapperFactory.adoc[`WrapperFactory`] to invoke child actions/properties, then those sub-executions are captured as a call-graph.
The `Execution` is thus a graph structure.

If a bulk action is performed (as per an action annotated using xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#invokeOn[`@Action#invokeOn`]), then this will result in multiple ``Interaction``s, one per selected object (not one `Interaction` with multiple top-level ``Execution``s).

It is possible for ``Interaction.Execution``s to be persisted; this is supported by the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s publishmq module, for example.
Persistent``Interaction``s support several use cases:

* they enable profiling of the running application (which actions are invoked then most often, what is their response time)

* if auditing is configured (using xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`]), they provide better audit information, since the
`Interaction.Execution` captures the 'cause' of an interaction and can be correlated to the audit records (the "effect" of the interaction) by way of the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/mixins.adoc#HasUniqueId[`transactionId`]

== API

The public API of the service consists of several related classes:

* `InteractionContext` domain service itself:
* `Interaction` class, obtainable from the `InteractionContext`
* `Execution` class, obtainable from the `Interaction`.

The `Execution` class itself is abstract; there are two subclasses, `ActionInvocation` and `PropertyEdit`.

=== `InteractionContext`

The public API of the `InteractionContext` domain service itself consists of simply:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/iactn/InteractionContext.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> Returns the currently active {@link Interaction} for this thread.

This class is concrete (that is, it is also the implementation).

=== `Interaction`

The public API of the `Interaction` class consists of:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/iactn/Interaction.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> The unique identifier of this interaction.
<.> Returns a (list of) execution}s in the order that they were pushed.
Generally there will be just one entry in this list, but additional entries may arise from the use of mixins/contributions when re-rendering a modified object.
This will be the same value as held in `Command` (obtainable from xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`]).
<.> The current execution.
<.> The member `Execution` (action invocation or property edit) that preceded the current one.
<.> Generates numbers in a named sequence.
Used by the framework both to number successive interaction ``Execution``s and for events published by the xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`].

This class is concrete (is also the implementation).

=== `Interaction.Execution`

The `Interaction.Execution` (static nested) class represents an action invocation/property edit as a node in a call-stack execution graph.
Sub-executions can be performed using the
xref:refguide:applib-svc:WrapperFactory.adoc[`WrapperFactory`].

It has the following public API:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class Execution {
    public Interaction getInteraction();            // <1>
    public InteractionType getInteractionType();    // <2>
    public String getMemberIdentifier();            // <3>
    public Object getTarget();                      // <4>

    public String getTargetClass();                 // <5>
    public String getTargetMember();

    public Execution getParent();                   // <6>
    public List<Execution> getChildren();

    public AbstractDomainEvent getEvent();          // <7>

    public Timestamp getStartedAt();                // <8>
    public Timestamp getCompletedAt();

    public Object getReturned();                    // <9>
    public Exception getThrew();

    public T getDto();                              // <10>
}
----
<1> The owning `Interaction`.
<2> Whether this is an action invocation or a property edit.
<3> A string uniquely identifying the action or property (similar to Javadoc syntax).
<4> The object on which the action is being invoked or property edited.
In the case of a mixin this will be the mixin object itself (rather than the mixed-in object).
<5> A human-friendly description of the class of the target object, and of the name of the action invoked/property edited on the target object.
<6> The parent action/property that invoked this action/property edit (if any), and any actions/property edits made in turn via the xref:refguide:applib-svc:WrapperFactory.adoc[`WrapperFactory`].
<7> The domain event fired via the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] representing the execution of this action invocation/property edit.
<8> The date/time at which this execution started/completed.
<9> The object returned by the action invocation/property edit, or the exception thrown.
For `void` methods and for actions returning collections, the value will be `null`.
<10> A DTO (instance of the xref:refguide:schema:ixn.adoc["ixn" schema]) being a serializable representation of this action invocation/property edit.

[NOTE]
====

Unlike the similar xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`] domain service (discussed xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc#Related-Classes[below]) there is no domain service to different implementations of `Interaction` to be used.
That said, the framework simply instantiates the `Interaction` using the
xref:refguide:applib-svc:FactoryService.adoc[`FactoryService`].
If a different implementation of `Interaction` was required, then a custom implementation of
xref:refguide:applib-svc:FactoryService.adoc[`FactoryService`] could always be supplied.
====

There are two concrete subclasses of `Execution`.

The first is `ActionInvocation`, representing the execution of an action being invoked:

[source,java]
----
public class ActionInvocation extends Execution {
    public List<Object> getArgs();                  // <1>
}
----
<1> The objects passed in as the arguments to the action's parameters.
Any of these could be `null`.

The second is `PropertyEdit`, and naturally enough represents the execution of a property being edited:

[source,java]
----
public class PropertyEdit extends Execution {
    public Object getNewValue();                    // <1>
}
----
<1> The object used as the new value of the property.
Could be `null` if the property is being cleared.

== Implementation

This class (`o.a.i.applib.services.iactn.InteractionContext`) is also the default implementation.

== Interacting with the services

Typically domain objects will have little need to interact with the `InteractionContext` and `Interaction` directly.
The services are used within the framework however, primarily to support the
xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`] SPI, and to emit domain events over the
xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`].

== Related Classes

This service is very similar in nature to xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`], in that the `Interaction` object accessed through it is very similar to the `Command` object obtained from the `CommandContext`.
The principle distinction is that while `Command` represents the __intention__ to invoke an action or edit a property, the `Interaction` (and contained ``Execution``s) represents the actual execution.

//Most of the time a `Command` will be followed directly by its corresponding `Interaction`.
//However, if the `Command` is annotated to run in the background (using xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#commandExecuteIn()`], or is explicitly created through the xref:refguide:applib-svc:BackgroundService.adoc[`BackgroundService`], then the actual interaction/execution is deferred until some other mechanism invokes the command (eg as described xref:userguide:btb:about.adoc#BackgroundCommandExecution[here]).
