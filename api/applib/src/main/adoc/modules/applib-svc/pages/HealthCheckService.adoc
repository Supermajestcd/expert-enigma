This SPI service integrates with Spring Boot's link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/HealthIndicator.html[HealthIndicator] SPI, surfaced through the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html[Spring Boot Actuator].

This is accessible from the `/actuator/health` endpoint.

The service, when called, will be within the context of a special internal user `__health` with the internal role `__health-role`.

This service was introduced to allow deployment infrastructure to monitor the app and (potentially) restart it if required.
For example, if deploying to Docker then both Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are orchestrators that can perform this task.


== SPI

The SPI defined by `HealthCheckService` is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/health/HealthCheckService.java[tags="refguide"]
----

== Implementation

The framework provides no default implementation, but the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[simpleapp] starter app provides a sample implementation:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Named("domainapp.HealthCheckServiceImpl")
@Log4j2
public class HealthCheckServiceImpl implements HealthCheckService {

    private final SimpleObjects simpleObjects;

    @Inject
    public HealthCheckServiceImpl(SimpleObjects simpleObjects) {
        this.simpleObjects = simpleObjects;
    }

    @Override
    public Health check() {
        try {
            simpleObjects.ping();
            return Health.ok();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            return Health.error(ex);
        }
    }
}
