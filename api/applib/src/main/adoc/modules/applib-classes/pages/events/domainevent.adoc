This section catalogues the various domain event classes defined by Apache Isis.

These events are broadcast on the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`].
The domain events are broadcast as a result of being specified in the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#domainEvent[`@Action#domainEvent()`],  xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#domainEvent[`@Property#domainEvent()`] or xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc#domainEvent[`@Collection#domainEvent()`] attributes.

They are listed in the table below.
