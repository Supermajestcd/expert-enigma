The `@javax.annotation.PreDestroy` annotation, as defined in link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250[JSR-250], recognized by Apache Isis as a callback method on domain services to be called just as they go out of scope.

For the default application-scoped (singleton) domain services, this means that the method, if present, is called just prior to the termination of the application.
For xref:refguide:applib-ant:IsisSessionScope.adoc[`@IsisSessionScope`] domain services, the method is called at the end of the request.

The signature of the method is:

[source,java]
----
@PreDestroy                           <.>
public void deinit() { /* ... */ }    <.>
----

<.> It is not necessary to annotate the method with xref:refguide:applib-ant:Programmatic.adoc[`@Programmatic`]; it will be automatically excluded from the Apache Isis metamodel.
<.> the method can have any name, but must have `public` visibility, and accept no arguments.

Other use cases include obtaining connections to external datasources, eg subscribing to an ActiveMQ router, say, or initializing/cleaning up a background scheduler such as Quartz.
