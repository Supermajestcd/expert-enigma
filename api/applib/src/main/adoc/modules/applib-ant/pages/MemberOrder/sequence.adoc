// TODO: v2: replace @MemberOrder#sequence() with @PropertyLayout#sequence().

The `sequence` attribute orders pathsToInclude that have been grouped together.

* For properties, this means ordering properties within a property group (fieldset)

* For actions, it means ordering actions that have been associated with the same property (or panel of that property's fieldset).

For more on layouts, see the xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[object layout] chapter in the user guide.
