The `@IsisSessionScope` annotation indicates that a xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainService.adoc[domain service] should be scoped with the Apache Isis session rather than a singleton.
An Apache Isis session is created for each HTTP request, and so this annotation is conceptually very similar to the link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299[JSR-299] `@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` annotation.

A number of the built-in domain services uses this annotation, including xref:refguide:applib-svc:Scratchpad.adoc[`Scratchpad`] and
xref:refguide:applib-svc:QueryResultsCache.adoc[`QueryResultsCache`].

One small wrinkle: these session-scoped services must be injected using the `Provider` idiom, not directly.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class SomeRepository {
    // ...
    @Inject
    Provider<QueryResultsCache> queryResultsCacheProvider;
}
----

If the session-scoped service is accidentally injected directly, then the framework will fail-fast with a suitable error message.
