Actions can be hidden at the domain-level, indicating that they are not visible to the end-user.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#hidden[`@ActionLayout#hidden`] or xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layouts] such that the action can be hidden at the view layer.
Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @Action(hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE)
    public void updateStatus() {
        // ...
    }

    ...
}
----

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The action should be hidden at all times.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
The action should not be hidden.


The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.
