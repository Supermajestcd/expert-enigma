The `@HomePage` annotation allows a _single_ (no-arg, query-only) action on a _single_ domain service to be nominated as the action to invoke for the default home page.
This often returns a view model that acts as some sort of dashboard, presenting key information and makeing the most commonly used actions easy to invoke.

For example, a todo app could use `@HomePage` to return a dashboard of todo items to complete:

image::reference-annotations/HomePage/HomePage.png[width="800px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-annotations/HomePage/HomePage.png"]


The corresponding code is:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class TodoAppDashboardService  {
    @Action(
            semantics = SemanticsOf.SAFE
    )
    @HomePage
    public TodoAppDashboard lookup() {
        return serviceRegistry.injectServicesInto(new TodoAppDashboard());
    }
    @Inject
    ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry;
}
----

where `TodoAppDashboard` is:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature = Nature.VIEW_MODEL)
public class TodoAppDashboard {
    public String title() { return "Dashboard"; }

    public List<ToDoItem> getNotYetComplete() { /* ... */ }
    public List<ToDoItem> getComplete() { /* ... */ }

    public Blob exportToWordDoc() { /* ... */ }  // <1>
}
----
<1> associated using xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] with the `notYetComplete` collection.

The other two actions shown in the above screenshot -- `exportAsXml` and `downloadLayout` -- are actually contributed to the `TodoAppDashboard` through various domain services, as is the `downloadLayout` action.
