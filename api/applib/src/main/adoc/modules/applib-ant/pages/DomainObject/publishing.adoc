The `publishing` attribute determines whether and how a modified object instance is published via the registered implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`].

A common use case is to notify external "downstream" systems of changes in the state of the Apache Isis application.

The default value for the attribute is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.publishing[`isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.publishing`] configuration property is used to determine the whether the domain object's changes are published:

* `all`
+
all changed objects are published

* `none`
+
no changed objects are published

If there is no configuration property in `application.properties` then publishing is automatically disabled for domain objects.

This default can be overridden on an object-by-object basis; if `publishing()` is set to `ENABLED` then changed instances of the domain class are published irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the changed instances are _not_ published, again irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    publishing=Publishing.ENABLED   // <.>
)
public class InterestRate {
    ...
}
----
<.> because set to enabled, will be published irrespective of the configured value.

This attribute is also supported for:

* xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#publishing[actions]
+
where it controls whether action invocations are published as events, and for

* xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#publishing[properties]
+
where it controls whether property edits are published as events.
