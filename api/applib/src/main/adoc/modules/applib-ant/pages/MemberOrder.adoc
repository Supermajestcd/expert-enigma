// TODO: v2: replace @MemberOrder#name() with @PropertyLayout#group(); replace @MemberOrder#sequence() with @PropertyLayout#sequence().

The `@MemberOrder` annotation is used to specify the relative order of domain object members, that is: properties, collections and actions.

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-ant:example$annotation/MemberOrder.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:MemberOrder.adoc#name[`name()`]
+
Names a group of (property) members.
All properties with this name will be grouped together.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:MemberOrder.adoc#sequence[`sequence()`]
+
Defines an ordering for members, within their container.

As this is an important topic, there is a xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc[separate chapter] that discussed object layout in full.


[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc[`@Collection`], xref:refguide:applib-ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`], xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc[`@Property`]) and xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc[`@PropertyLayout`] that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.
 This is specifically so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
