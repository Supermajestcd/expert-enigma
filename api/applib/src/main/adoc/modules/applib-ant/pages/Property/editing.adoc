The `editing` attribute can be used to prevent a property from being modified or cleared, ie to make it read-only.

The related `editingDisabledReason` attribute specifies the a hard-coded reason why the property cannot be modified directly.

Whether a property is enabled or disabled depends upon these factors:

* whether the domain object has been configured as immutable through the xref:refguide:DomainObject/editing.adoc[`@DomainObject#editing()`] attribute

* else (that is, if the domain object's editability is specified as being `AS_CONFIGURED`), then the value of the xref:refguide:config:configuring-core.adoc[configuration property] `isis.objects.editing`.  If set to `false`, then the object's properties (and collections) are __not__ editable

* else, then the value of the `@Property(editing=...)` attribute itself

* else, the result of invoking any supporting xref:refguide:applib-cm:rgcms.adoc#\_rgcms_methods_prefixes_disable[`disable...()`] supporting methods


Thus, to make a property read-only even if the object would otherwise be editable, use:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Property(
        editing=Editing.DISABLED,
        editingDisabledReason="The credit rating is derived from multiple factors"
    )
    public int getInitialCreditRating(){ /* ... */ }
    public void setInitialCreditRating(int initialCreditRating) { /* ... */ }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
To reiterate, it is _not_ possible to enable editing for a property if editing has been disabled at the object-level.

This attribute can also be specified for:

* xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc#editing[collections]
* xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#editing[domain object].
