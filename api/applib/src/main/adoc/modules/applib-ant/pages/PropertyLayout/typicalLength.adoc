The `typicalLength` attribute indicates the typical length of a string property.
It is ignored for properties of other types.
The attribute is also supported for xref:refguide:applib-ant:ParameterLayout.adoc#typicalLength[parameters].

The information is intended as a hint to the UI to determine the space that should be given to render a particular string property.
That said, note that the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] uses the maximum space available for all fields, so in effect ignores this attribute.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(length=30)
    @ParameterLayout(typicalLength=20)
    @Getter @Setter
    private String firstName;

    // ...
}
----

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.
