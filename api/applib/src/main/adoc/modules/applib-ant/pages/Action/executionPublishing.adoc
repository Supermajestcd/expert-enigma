CAUTION: TODO: v2 - publishing/auditing got a complete overhaul

The `executionPublishing` attribute determines whether and how an action invocation is published via the registered implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`ExecutionSubscriber`].

A common use case is to notify external "downstream" systems of changes in the state of the Apache Isis application.
The xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.action.publishing[`isis.applib.annotation.action.executionPublishing`] configuration property is used to determine the whether the action is published:

* `all`
+
all action invocations are published

* `ignoreSafe` (or `ignoreQueryOnly`)
+
invocations of actions with safe (read-only) semantics are ignored, but actions which may modify data are not ignored

* `none`
+
no action invocations are published

If there is no configuration property in `application.properties` then publishing is automatically enabled.

This default can be overridden on an action-by-action basis; if `executionPublishing()` is set to `ENABLED` then the action invocation is published irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the action invocation is _not_ published, again irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Action(executionPublishing=Publishing.ENABLED)    // <.>
    public Invoice generateInvoice(...) {
        // ...
    }
}
----

<.> because set to enabled, will be published irrespective of the configured value.

This attribute is also supported for:

* xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#entityChangePublishing[domain objects]
+ where it controls whether changed objects are published as events, and for

* xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#executionPublishing[properties]
+
where it controls whether property edits are published as events.
