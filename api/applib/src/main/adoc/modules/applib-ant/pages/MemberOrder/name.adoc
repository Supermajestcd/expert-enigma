// TODO: v2: replace @MemberOrder#name() with @PropertyLayout#group().

The interpretation of the `name` attribute varies dependent on the type of object member it is annotated upon.

== Properties

For properties, the `name` attribute is used to group properties together.
It corresponds to a `<fieldset>` if using xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[layout files].

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @MemberOrder(name = "Personal Details", sequence = "1.0")
    private String firstName;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Personal Details", sequence = "2.0")
    private String lastName;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address", sequence = "1.0")
    private String addressLine1;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address", sequence = "2.0")
    private String addressLine2;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address", sequence = "3.0")
    private String city;

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address", sequence = "4.0")
    private String zipCode;

    // ...
}
----

TIP: It's possible to combine `@MemberOrder` with xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[layout file].
Use the layout file to define the positioning of the fieldsets, and use `@MemberOrder` to organise the properties within the fieldset.

== Actions

For actions, the `name` attribute indicates the name of a property to associate the action with.

TIP: For actions, `@Member#name()` and xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#associateWith()` are the same.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @MemberOrder(name = "Personal Details")
    public Customer updateName(String firstName, String lastName) {
        // ...
    }

    @MemberOrder(name = "Address")
    public Customer changeAddress(String firstName, String lastName) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
----

TIP: the xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#position[`@ActionLayout#position()`] to indicate whether the action should be rendered beneath the property, or on its fieldset panel's header.

== Collections

The `name` attribute is ignored when annotated on collections.
