The `bookmarking` attribute indicates that an entity is automatically bookmarked.
This attribute is also supported for  xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#bookmarking[domain objects].

In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket Viewer], a link to a bookmarked object is shown in the bookmarks panel:

Note that this screenshot shows an earlier version of the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
public class ToDoItem ... {
    ...
}
----

indicates that the `ToDoItem` class is bookmarkable:

It is also possible to nest bookmarkable entities.
For example:

For example, the `Property` entity "[OXF] Oxford Super Mall" is a root bookmark, but the `Unit` child entity "[OXF-001] Unit 1" only appears as a bookmark _but only if_ its parent `Property` has already been bookmarked.

This is accomplished with the following annotations:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
public class Property {
    // ...
}
----

and

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD)
public abstract class Unit {
    // ...
}
----

The nesting can be done to any level.
