The `named` attribute explicitly specifies the domain object's name, overriding the name that would normally be inferred from the Java source code.

[TIP]
====
We recommend that you only use this attribute when the desired name cannot be used in Java source code.
Examples of that include a name that would be a reserved Java keyword (eg "package"), or a name that has punctuation, eg apostrophes.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
   named="Customer"
)
public class CustomerImpl implements Customer{
   // ...
}
----

It's also possible to specify a xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#plural[plural form] of the name, used by the framework when rendering a standalone collection of the domain object.

[TIP]
====
The framework also provides a separate, powerful mechanism for xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[internationalization].
