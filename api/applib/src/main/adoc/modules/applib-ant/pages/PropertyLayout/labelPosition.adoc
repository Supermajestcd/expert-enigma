The `labelPosition` attribute determines the positioning of labels for properties.

The positioning of labels is typically `LEFT`, but can be positioned to the `TOP`.
The one exception is xref:refguide:applib-ant:ParameterLayout.adoc#multiLine[`multiLine`] string properties, where the label defaults to `TOP` automatically (to provide as much real-estate for the multiline text field as possible).

For boolean properties a positioning of `RIGHT` is also allowed; this is ignored for all other types.

It is also possible to suppress the label altogether, using `NONE`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ToDoItem {

    @PropertyLayout(
        labelPosition=LabelPosition.TOP
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private String description;

    // ...
}
----

To get an idea of how these are rendered (in the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer]), we can look at some examples of most of these various label positions.

The default `LEFT` label positioning is used by the `cost` property:

image::reference-annotations/PropertyLayout/labelPosition-LEFT.png[width="720px"]


The `TOP` label positioning is used by the `category` property:

image::reference-annotations/PropertyLayout/labelPosition-TOP.png[width="720px"]


Labels are suppressed, using `NONE`, for the `subcategory` property:

image::reference-annotations/PropertyLayout/labelPosition-NONE.png[width="720px"]


The todoapp's `complete` (boolean) property renders the label to the LEFT (the default):

image::reference-annotations/PropertyLayout/labelPosition-boolean-LEFT.png[width="720px"]

Moving the label to the `RIGHT` looks like:

image::reference-annotations/PropertyLayout/labelPosition-boolean-RIGHT.png[width="720px"]

== Default settings

If you want a consistent look-n-feel throughout the app, eg all property labels to the top, then it'd be rather frustrating to have to annotate every property.

Instead, a default can be specified using the xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.property-layout.label-position[`isis.applib.annotation.property-layout.label-position`] configuration property:

[source,ini]
.application.properties
----
isis.applib.annotation.property-layout.label-position=TOP
----

or

[source,ini]
.application.properties
----
isis.applib.annotation.property-layout.label-position=LEFT
----

If these are not present then Apache Isis will render according to internal defaults.
At the time of writing, this means labels are to the left for all datatypes except multiline strings.


== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.

This attribute can also be specified for xref:refguide:applib-ant:ParameterLayout.adoc#labelPosition[parameters].
