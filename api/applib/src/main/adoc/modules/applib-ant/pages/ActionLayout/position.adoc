The `position` attribute pertains only to actions that have been associated with properties using xref:refguide:applib-ant:MemberOrder.adoc[`@MemberOrder#named`].
For these actions, it specifies the positioning of the action's button with respect to the field representing the object property.

The attribute can take one of four values: `BELOW`, `RIGHT`, `PANEL` or `PANEL_DROPDOWN`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @Property( editing=Editing.DISABLED )
    @Getter @Setter
    private BigDecimal cost;

    @Property( editing=Editing.DISABLED )
    @Getter @Setter
    private String location;

    @MemberOrder( named="cost" )                        // <.>
    @ActionLayout(
        named="Update",                                 // <.>
        position=Position.BELOW                         // <.>
    )
    public Customer updateCost(BigDecimal cost ) {
        // ...
    }

    @MemberOrder( named="location" )
    @ActionLayout(
        named="Update",
        position=Position.BELOW
    )
    public Customer updateLocation(String latitude, String longitude) {
        // ...
    }
}
----

<.> associate the "updateCost" action with the "cost" property

<.> give the action an abbreviated name, because the fact that the "cost" property is to be updated is implied by its positioning

<.> positioning of the action's button


The default is `BELOW`, which is rendered (by the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer]) as shown below:

image::reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-BELOW.png[width="720px"]


If the action is positioned as `RIGHT`, then the action's button is rendered to the right of the property's field, in a compact drop-down.
This is ideal if there are many actions associated with a property:

image::reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-RIGHT.png[width="720px"]



If the action is positioned as `PANEL`, then the action's button is rendered on the header of the panel that contains the property:

image::reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-PANEL.png[width="720px"]



And finally, if the action is positioned as `PANEL_DROPDOWN`, then the action's button is again rendered on the panel header, but as a drop-down:


image::reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-PANEL_DROPDOWN.png[width="720px"]



If there are multiple actions associated with a single property then the positioning can be mix'ed-and-match'ed as required.
If the `PANEL` or `PANEL_DROPDOWN` are used, then (as the screenshots above show) the actions from potentially multiple properties grouped by that panel will be shown together.

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.

The fact that the layout is dynamic (does not require a rebuild/restart) is particularly useful in that the look-n-feel can be easily experimented with and adjusted.
