The `@Property` annotation applies to properties collecting together all domain semantics within a single annotation.

It is also possible to apply the annotation to actions of domain services that are acting as contributed properties.

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-ant:example$annotation/Property.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#command[`command()`]
+
Whether the property edit should be reified into a `o.a.i.applib.` +
`services.command.Command` object through the xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`] service.

<.> `commandPersistence()`
+
Whether the reified `Command` (as provided by the `CommandContext` domain service) should actually be persisted (assuming an appropriate implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] has been configured).

<.> `commandExecuteIn()`
+
Whether to execute the command immediately, or to persist it (assuming that an appropriate implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] has been configured) such that a background scheduler can execute the command asynchronously

<.> `commandDtoProcessor()`
+
If the `Command` also implements `CommandWithDto` (meaning that it can return a `CommandDto`, in other words be converted into an XML memento), then optionally specifies the implementation of a `CommandDtoProcessor` that can refine this XML.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#domainevent[`domainEvent()`]
+
The event type to be posted to the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] to broadcast the property's business rule checking (hide, disable, validate) and its modification (before and after).

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#editing[`editing()`]
+
Whether a property can be modified or cleared from within the UI

<.> `editingDisabledReason()`
+
The reason that this property cannot be modified.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#fileaccept[`fileAccept()`]
+
Hints the file type (media type or file extension) to be uploaded to a xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/value-types.adoc#Blob[`Blob`]
 or xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/value-types.adoc#Clob[`Clob`]. +
+
Note that this does not prevent the user from uploading some other file type; rather it merely defaults the file type in the file open dialog.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#hidden[`hidden()`]
+
Indicates where (in the UI) the property should be hidden from the user.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#maxlength[`maxLength()`]
+
Maximum number of characters for string parameters; ignored otherwise +
+
TIP: In many/most cases you should however use xref:refguide:applib-ant:Column.adoc[`@Column#length()`]

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#mementoserialization[`mementoSerialization()`]
+
Whether to exclude from snapshots. +

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#mustsatisfy[`mustSatisfy()`]
+
Implementation of `o.a.i.applib.spec.Specification` that allows arbitrary validation to be applied.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#optionality[`optionality()`]
+
Specifies a property is optional rather than mandatory
+
TIP: In many/most cases you should however use xref:refguide:applib-ant:Column.adoc[`@Column#allowsNull()`]

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#projecting[`projecting()`]
+
Indicates that owning object is a view model that is acting as a projection of the underlying entity referenced by this property.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#publishing[`publishing()`]
+
Determines whether the editing of a property should be published.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc#regexpattern[`regexPattern()`]
+
Validates the contents of a string parameter against the regular expression pattern

<.> `regexPatternFlags()`
+
Value of flags as normally passed to `java.util.regex.` +
`Pattern#compile(...)`, modifying the compilation of the regular expression

<.> `regexPatternReplacement()`
+
Unused.


For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class Customer {
    public static class EmailSpecification extends AbstractSpecification<String> {
        public String satisfiesSafely(String proposed) {
            return EmailUtil.ensureValidEmail(proposed);    // <1>
        }
    }
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true")                // <2>
    @Property(
        maxLength=30,
        mustSatisfy=EmailSpecification.class,
        regexPattern = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+",
        regexPatternFlags=Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE
    )
    public String getEmailAddress() { /* ... */ }
    public void setEmailAddress(String emailAddress) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
<1> the (fictitious) `EmailUtil.ensureValid(...)` (omitted for brevity) returns a string explaining if an email is invalid
<2> generally use instead of the `@Property#optionality` attribute





[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc[`@Collection`], xref:refguide:applib-ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc[`@PropertyLayout`]) that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.  This is specifically
so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
