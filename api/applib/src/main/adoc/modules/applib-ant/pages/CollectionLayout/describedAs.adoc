The `describedAs` attribute is used to provide a short description of the collection to the user.
In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'.

The `describedAs` attribute can also be specified for xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc#describedAs[properties], xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#describedAs[actions], xref:refguide:applib-ant:ParameterLayout.adoc#describedAs[parameters] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#describedAs[domain objects].

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ToDoItem {

    @CollectionLayout(
        describedAs = "Todo items to be completed before this one"
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet<ToDoItem> dependencies = ...

}
----


== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.
