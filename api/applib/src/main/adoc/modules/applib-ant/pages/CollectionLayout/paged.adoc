The `paged` attribute specifies the number of rows to display in a (parented) collection.

[WARNING]
====
The xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] currently does not support paging.
The xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] _does_ support paging, but note that the paging is performed client-side rather than server-side.

We therefore recommend that large collections should instead be modelled as actions (to allow filtering to be applied to limit the number of rows).
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Order {

    @CollectionLayout(paged=15)
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet<OrderLine> details = ...

}
----

It is also possible to specify a global default for the page size of parented collections, using the xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.collection-layout.paged[`isis.applib.annotation.collection-layout.paged`] configuration property.

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.

This attribute can also be applied to:

* xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#paged[domain objects]
