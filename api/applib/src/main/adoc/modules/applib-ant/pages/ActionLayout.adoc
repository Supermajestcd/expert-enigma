The `@ActionLayout` annotation applies to actions, collecting together all UI hints within a single annotation.

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-ant:example$annotation/ActionLayout.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#bookmarking[`bookmarking()`]
+
Indicates if an action (with safe xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#semantics[action semantics]) is automatically bookmarked.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#cssClass[`cssClass()`]
+
An additional CSS class around the HTML that represents for the action, to allow targetted styling in xref:refguide:config:application-specific/application-css.adoc[`application.css`]. +

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#cssClassFa[`cssClassFa()`]
+
Specify a link:http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/[Font awesome] icon name for the action's menu link or icon.

<.> `cssClassFaPosition()`
+
Positioning of the icon on the button/menu item.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#describedAs[`describedAs()`]
+
Provides a short description of the action, eg for rendering as a 'tool tip'.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#hidden[`hidden()`]
+
Indicates where (in the UI) the action should be hidden from the user.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#named[`named()`]
+
To override the name inferred from the action's name in code. +
A typical use case is if the desired name is a reserved Java keyword, such as `default` or `package`.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#position[`position()`]
+
For actions associated (using xref:refguide:applib-ant:MemberOrder.adoc[`@MemberOrder#named`]) with properties, the positioning of the action's button with respect to the property

<.> `promptStyle()`
+
How to render the action prompt / property edit form : inline, dialog, sidebar etc.

<.> `redirectPolicy()`
+
For the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer], whether to re-render the page after invoking this action, even if the result is the same.
+
Not re-rendering can provide a smoother UI experience.

// TODO: v2 - missing subpages for `promptStyle` and `redirectPolicy`

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItems {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)             // <1>
    @ActionLayout(
        bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT,
        cssClass="x-key",
        cssClassFa="fa-checkbox",
        describedAs="Mark the todo item as not complete after all",
        hidden=Where.NOWHERE                        // <2>
    )
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> required for bookmarkable actions
<2> default value, so could be omitted


[TIP]
====
As an alternative to using the `@ActionLayout` annotation, a xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used (and is generally to be preferred since it is more flexible/powerful).
