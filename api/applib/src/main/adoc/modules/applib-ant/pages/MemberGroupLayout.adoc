The `@MemberGroupLayout` annotation specifies how an object's properties and collections are grouped together into columns, also specifying the relative positioning of those columns.  It works in conjunction with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:MemberOrder.adoc[`@MemberOrder`] annotation.

The annotation defines four attributes:

* `columnSpans()` -- of type `int[]` -- which specifies the relative column sizes of the three columns that render properties as well as a fourth column that renders only collections

* `left()` -- of type `String[]` - that specifies the order of the property groups (inferred from `@MemberOrder#name()`) as applied to properties) in the left-most column

* `middle()` -- of type `String[]` - that specifies the order of the property groups (if any) as applied to properties) in the middle column
