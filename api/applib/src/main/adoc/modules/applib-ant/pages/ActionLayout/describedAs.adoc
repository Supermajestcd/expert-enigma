The `describedAs` attribute is used to provide a short description of the action to the user.
In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @ActionLayout(describedAs=
        "Place a repeat order of the last (most recently placed) order")
    public Order placeRepeatOrder(...) { /* ... */ }
}
----

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.
