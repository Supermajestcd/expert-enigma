The `multiLine` attribute specifies that the text field for a string property should span multiple lines.
It is ignored for other property types.
The attribute is also supported for xref:refguide:applib-ant:ParameterLayout.adoc#multiLine[parameters].

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class BugReport {

    @PropertyLayout(
        numberOfLines=10
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private String stepsToReproduce;

    // ...
}
----

Here the `stepsToReproduce` will be displayed in a text area of 10 rows.

[NOTE]
====
If set > 1 (as would normally be the case), then the default xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc#labelPosition[`labelPosition`] defaults to `TOP` (rather than `LEFT`, as would normally be the case).
====

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.
