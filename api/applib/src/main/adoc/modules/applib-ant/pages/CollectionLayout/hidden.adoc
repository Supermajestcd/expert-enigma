The `hidden` attribute indicates where (in the UI) the collection should be hidden from the user.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc#hidden[`@Collection#hidden`] to hide an action at the domain layer.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ToDoItem {

    @CollectionLayout(
        hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet<ToDoItem> dependencies = ...

}
----

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE`
+
The collection should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.ANYWHERE`
+
Synonym for everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS`
+
The collection should be hidden when displayed within an object form.

* `Where.NOWHERE`
+
The collection should not be hidden.

The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.

== See also

This attribute can also be applied to:

* xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#hidden[actions]
* xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc#hidden[properties].
