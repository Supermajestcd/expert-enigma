The `describedAs` attribute is used to provide a short description of the action parameter to the user.  In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'.  The `describedAs` attribute can also be specified for xref:refguide:applib-ant:CollectionLayout.adoc#describedAs[collections],  xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc#describedAs[properties], xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#describedAs[actions] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#describedAs[domain objects].

Descriptions may be provided for objects, pathsToInclude (properties, collections and actions), and for individual parameters within an action method.

To provide a description for an individual action parameter, use the `describedAs` attribute in-line i.e. immediately before the parameter declaration.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    public Order placeOrder(
          Product product,
          @ParameterLayout(
              describedAs = "The quantity of the product being ordered"
          )
          int quantity) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
