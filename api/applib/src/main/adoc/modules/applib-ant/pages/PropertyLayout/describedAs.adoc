The `describedAs` attribute is used to provide a short description of the property to the user.  In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'. The attribute can also be specified for xref:refguide:applib-ant:CollectionLayout.adoc#describedAs[collections],  xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#describedAs[actions], xref:refguide:applib-ant:ParameterLayout.adoc#describedAs[parameters] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#describedAs[domain objects].

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @PropertyLayout(
        describedAs = "The name that the customer has indicated " +
                      "that they wish to be addressed as " +
                      "(e.g. Johnny rather than Jonathan)")
    private String firstName;

    // ...
}
----


== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.
