The `@Action` annotation groups together all domain-specific metadata for an invokable action on a domain object or domain service.

----

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#associateWith[`associateWith()`]
+
associates an action with another property or collection of the action.

<.> `associateWithSequence()`
+
the ordering of multiple actions associated with another property/collection.

<.> `commandDtoProcessor()`
+
If the xref:extensions:command-replay:about.adoc[Command Replay] extension is being used (for regression testing), provides a mechanism to process the `CommandDto` before being replicated from primary to secondary system

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#commandPublishing[`commandPublishing()`]
+
Whether the action invocation should be published to registered xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandSubscriber.adoc[`CommandSubscriber`]s as a `Command` object, that captures the details of this invocation. Typically so it can be logged using the xref:extensions:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] extension (for auditing or for regression testing using xref:extensions:command-replay:about.adoc[Command Replay]).

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#domainEvent[`domainEvent()`]
+
The event type to be posted to the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] to broadcast the action's business rule checking (hide, disable, validate) and its invocation (pre-execute and post-execute).

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#executionPublishing[`executionPublishing()`]
+
Whether the action invocation should be published to registered xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`ExecutionSubscriber`]s as an `Execution` object, that captures the details of this invocation.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#hidden[`hidden()`]
+
Indicates where (in the UI) the action should be hidden from the user.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#restrictTo[`restrictTo()`]
+
Whether the action is only available in prototyping mode, or whether it is available also in production mode.

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#semantics[`semantics()`]
+
The action's semantics (ie whether objects are modified as the result of invoking this action, and if so whether reinvoking the action would result in no further change; if not whether the results can be cached for the remainder of the request).
+
The `...ARE_YOU_SURE` variants cause a confirmation dialog to be displayed in the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer].

<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#typeOf[`typeOf()`]
+
If the action returns a collection, hints as to the run-time type of the objects within that collection (as a fallback)


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class CompletedEvent extends ActionDomainEvent<ToDoItem> { }
    @Action(
        commandPublishing=Publishing.ENABLED,
        commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.FOREGROUND,          // <.>
        commandPersistence=CommandPersistence.NOT_PERSISTED,   // <.>
        domainEvent=CompletedEvent.class,
        hidden = Where.NOWHERE,                                // <.>
        executionPublishing = Publishing.ENABLED,
        semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT
    )
    public ToDoItem completed() { /* ... */ }
}
