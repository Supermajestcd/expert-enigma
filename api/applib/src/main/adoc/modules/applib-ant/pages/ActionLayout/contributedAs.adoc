For mixin actions that could qualify as derived properties or collections, the `contributedAs` attribute determines _how_ it is contributed.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Mixin
    public class mostRecentOrders {                             // <.>
        @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
        @ActionLayout(contributedAs=Contributed.AS_ASSOCIATION) // <.>
        public List<Order> $$() {
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }
}
----

<.> mixin as a nested (non-static) class
<.> contributed as an association, that is, a collection.
