The lifecycle callback methods notify a domain entity about its interaction within the persistence lifecycle.
For example, the entity is notified immediately prior to being persisted, or when it is about to be updated.

[WARNING]
====
Note that these callbacks are fired by Apache Isis rather than JDO.
In the future we may deprecate them because there are better mechanisms available using a subscriber for the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/lifecycleevent.adoc[lifecycle event]s.

The lifecycle callback methods supported by Apache Isis are:
