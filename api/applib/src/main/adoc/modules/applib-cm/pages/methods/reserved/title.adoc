Every object is represented by a title.
This appears both as a main header for the object when viewed as well as being used as a hyperlink within properties and collections.
It therefore must contain enough information for the end-user to distinguish the object from any others.

This is most commonly done by including some unique key within the title, for example a customer's SSN, or an order number, and so forth.
However note that Apache Isis itself does _not_ require the title to be unique; it is merely recommended in most cases.

An object's title can be constructed in various ways, but the most flexible is to use the `title()` method.
The signature of this method is usually:

[source,java]
----
public String title() { /* ... */ }
----

Note that Apache Isis' xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[i18n support] extends this so that titles can also be internationalized.

For example, the http://github.com/apache/isis-app-todoapp[TodoApp] uses this technique to add an overlay for todo items that have been completed:

[source,java]
----
public String title() {
    final TitleBuffer buf = new TitleBuffer();                              // <1>
    buf.append(getDescription());
    if (isComplete()) {                                                     // <2>
        buf.append("- Completed!");
    } else {
        try {
            final LocalDate dueBy = wrapperFactory.wrap(this).getDueBy();   // <3>
            if (dueBy != null) {
                buf.append(" due by", dueBy);
            }
        } catch(final HiddenException ignored) {                            // <4>
        }
    }
    return buf.toString();
}
----
<1> simple xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes.adoc#TitleBuffer[utility class] to help construct the title string
<2> imperative conditional logic
<3> using the xref:refguide:applib-svc:WrapperFactory.adoc[`WrapperFactory`] to determine if the `dueBy` field is visible for this user ...
<4> ... but ignore if not

As the example above shows, the implementation can be as complex as you like.

In many cases, though, you may be able to use the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Title.adoc[`@Title`] annotation.
