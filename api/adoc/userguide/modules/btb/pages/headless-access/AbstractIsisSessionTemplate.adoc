The `AbstractIsisSessionTemplate` class (whose name is inspired by the Spring framework's naming convention for similar classes that query http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jdbc.html#jdbc-JdbcTemplate[JDBC], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html#jms-jmstemplate[JMS], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/orm.html#orm-jpa-template[JPA] etc.) provides the mechanism to open up a 'session' within the Apache Isis framework, in order to resolve and interact with entities.

The class itself is intended to be subclassed:

[source,java]
.AbstractIsisSessionTemplate.java
----
public abstract class AbstractIsisSessionTemplate {

    public void execute(                                              // <.>
            final AuthenticationSession authSession,
            final Object context) {
        // ...
    }

    protected void doExecute(final Object context) {                  // <.>
        transactionService.executeWithinTransaction(()->{
            doExecuteWithTransaction(context);
        });
    }

    protected void doExecuteWithTransaction(final Object context) {}  // <.>
}
----
<.> `execute(...)` sets up the `IsisSession` and delegates to ...
<.> `doExecute(...)`, a hook method for subclasses to implement.
The passed object represents passes a context from the caller (eg the scheduler, cron job, JMS etc) that instantiated and executed the class.
<.> Alternatively, override the `doExecuteWithTransaction()`.

In fact, the initial `execute(...)` method implementation is simply:

[source,java]
----
public void execute(final AuthenticationSession authSession, final Object context) {
    isisSessionFactory.runAuthenticated(authSession, ()->{
        serviceInjector.injectServicesInto(this);
        doExecute(context);
    });
}
----

So, as an alternative to using `AbstractIsisSessionTemplate`, you could instead just use `IsisSessionFactory`.

If you _do_ use `AbstractIsisSessionTemplate`, note that it automatically inject any domain services into itself.
Thus, it is relatively easy for the subclass to "reach into" the domain, through injected services.
