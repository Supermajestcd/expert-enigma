As explained xref:building-blocks.adoc#business-rules[earlier], when a domain object is rendered in the UI or the end-user interacts with the domain object through the UI, the framework applies a series of precondition business rules to each object member.
These can be summarised as "see it, use it, do it".

.See it, use it, do it
****

* is the object member visible?

* if the object member is visible, is the object member enabled?

* for enabled object members, if the user then interacts with that member, are the supplied values valid (can the user "do it").
****

The framework provides a multitude of ways to implement these business rules.
One decoupled approach is using xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#domain-events[domain events]; the checks above correspond to the phases of the domain event.
A simpler approach is to just implement the business rules imperatively in the domain object, or in a mixin for the object.
