Apache Isis works by building a xref:core-concepts.adoc#metamodel[metamodel] of the domain objects: entities, domain services, view models and mixins.
Dependent on the xref:building-blocks.adoc#type-of-domain-objects[sort of domain object], the class methods represent both state -- (single-valued) xref:building-blocks.adoc#properties[properties] and (multi-valued) xref:building-blocks.adoc#collections[collections] -- and behaviour -- xref:building-blocks.adoc#actions[actions].

More specifically, both xref:building-blocks.adoc#domain-entities[entities] and xref:building-blocks.adoc#view-models[view models] can have properties, collections and actions, while xref:building-blocks.adoc#domain-services[domain services] have just actions.
xref:building-blocks.adoc#mixins[Mixins] also define only actions, though depending on their semantics they may be rendered as derived properties or collections on the domain object to which they contribute.

In the automatically generated UI a property is rendered as a field.
This can be either of a value type (a string, number, date, boolean etc) or can be a reference to another entity.
A collection is generally rendered as a table.

In order for Apache Isis to build its metamodel the domain objects must follow some conventions: what we call the _**Apache Isis Programming Model**_.
This is an extension of the pojo / JavaBean standard of yesteryear: properties and collections are getters/setters, while actions are simply any remaining `public` methods.

Additional metamodel semantics are inferred both imperatively from _supporting methods_ and declaratively from annotations.

In this section we discuss the mechanics of writing domain objects that comply with Apache Isis' programming model.

[TIP]
====
In fact, the Apache Isis programming model is extensible; you can teach Apache Isis new programming conventions and you can remove existing ones; ultimately they amount to syntax.
The only real fundamental that can't be changed is the notion that objects consist of properties, collections and actions.

You can learn more about extending Apache Isis programming model xref:userguide:btb:programming-model.adoc[here].
====

The Apache Isis programming model uses annotations to distinguish these object types:

* *view models* are annotated either with xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc[`@DomainObject(nature=VIEW_MODEL)`] or using xref:refguide:applib-ant:ViewModel.adoc[`@ViewModel`]; they are equivalent.
+
The framework will automatically manage the view model's state (properties only, not collections).
+
Or, if annotated using the JAXB `@XmlTypeAdapter` annotation, then the framework will use JAXB to manage the view models' properties _and_ collections.

* *domain entities* that are persisted to the database (as the vast majority will) are annotated with `@DomainObject(nature=ENTITY)`.
In addition such domain entities require ORM metadata.
+
For example, xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] requires the
`@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable` annotation.

* If a domain entity is a proxy for state managed in an external system, or merely for some state held in-memory, then `@DomainObject(nature=EXTERNAL_ENTITY)` or `@DomainObject(nature=INMEMORY_ENTITY)` can be used.
+
Such entities' state is managed by the framework, in the same ways as view models.
Indeed, they can additionally be annotated using `@XmlTypeAdapter` if required.

* *mixins* are annotated either with `@DomainObject(nature=MIXIN)` or using xref:refguide:applib-ant:Mixin.adoc[`@Mixin`].
+
As for view models, which is used is a matter of personal preference.

* *domain services*` are annotated with xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainService.adoc[`@DomainService(nature=...)`] where the nature is either `VIEW` or `REST`.
+
The former appear in all viewers (eg xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer]) , while the latter appear only in the REST API provided by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects Viewer].
+
Domain services that are _programmatic_ in nature should *not* be annotated with `@DomainService`.
Instead, just annotate using Spring's xref:https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html[`@Component`] or one of its specializations, eg
xref:https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html[`@Service`]
orxref:https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Repository.html[`@Repository`].

You can generally recognize an Apache Isis domain class because it will be probably be annotated using `@DomainObject` and `@DomainService`.

It's worth emphasising is that domain entities and view models hold state, whereas domain services are generally stateless.
There are some exceptions, for example the xref:refguide:applib-svc:Scratchpad.adoc[`Scratchpad`] service which allows arbitrary data to be shared between objects in a request.
Such services are scoped to the request using the framework's xref:refguide:applib-ant:IsisSessionScope.adoc[`@IsisSessionScope`]; this state is short-lived and usable only within a single request.

The framework also defines supplementary annotations, notably xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc[`@DomainObjectLayout`] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainServiceLayout.adoc[`@DomainServiceLayout`].
These provide hints relating to the layout of the domain object in the user interface.
Alternatively, these UI hints can be defined in a supplementary xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc[`.layout.xml`] file.
