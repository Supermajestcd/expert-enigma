## Setting up and Configurating IntelliJ

### Download and Install

WARNING: This doc used IntelliJ Community Edition 14.1.1, with screenshots taken for Windows.  If you're a MacOS user, I'm sure you can adapt :-)

https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[Download] latest version of IntelliJ Community Edition, and install:

Start the wizard, click through the welcome page:

.IntelliJ Installation Wizard - Welcome page
image::{_imagesdir}010-installing/010-welcome-page.png[width="400px"]

Choose the location to install the IDE:

.IntelliJ Installation Wizard - Choose Location
image::{_imagesdir}010-installing/020-choose-location.png[width="400px"]

Adjust any installation options as you prefer:

.IntelliJ Installation Wizard - Installation Options
image::{_imagesdir}010-installing/030-installation-options.png[width="400px"]

and the start menu:

.IntelliJ Installation Wizard - Start Menu Folder
image::{_imagesdir}010-installing/040-start-menu-folder.png[width="400px"]

and finish up the wizard:

.IntelliJ Installation Wizard - Completing the Wizard
image::{_imagesdir}010-installing/050-completing.png[width="400px"]

Later on we'll specify the Apache Isis/ASF code style settings, so for now select `I do not want to import settings`:

.IntelliJ Installation Wizard - Import Settings
image::{_imagesdir}010-installing/060-import-settings-or-not.png[width="400px"]

Finally, if you are young and trendy, set the UI theme to Darcula:

.IntelliJ Installation Wizard Set UI Theme
image::{_imagesdir}010-installing/070-set-ui-theme.png[width="600px"]




### New Project

In IntelliJ a project can contain multiple modules; these need not be physically located together.  (If you are previously an Eclipse user, you can think of it as similar to an Eclipse workspace).

Start off by creating a new project:

.IntelliJ Create New Project
image::{_imagesdir}020-create-new-project/010-new-project-create.png[width="400px"]

We want to create a new *Java* project:

.IntelliJ Create New Project - Create a Java project
image::{_imagesdir}020-create-new-project/020-java-project-setup-jdk.png[width="600px"]

We therefore need to specify the JDK.

NOTE: at the time of writing Isis supports only Java 7; Java 8 is scheduled for support in Isis v1.9.0


.IntelliJ Create New Java Project - Select the JDK
image::{_imagesdir}020-create-new-project/030-java-project-select-jdk.png[width="300px"]

Specify the directory containing the JDK:

.IntelliJ Create New Project - Select the JDK location
image::{_imagesdir}020-create-new-project/050-name-and-location.png[width="400px"]

Finally allow IntelliJ to create the directory for the new project:

.IntelliJ Create New Project
image::{_imagesdir}020-create-new-project/060-create-dir.png[width="200px"]



### Import Settings

Next we need to configure IntelliJ with ASF/Apache Isis' standard templates and coding conventions.  These are bundled as the `settings.jar` JAR file link:resources/isis-settings.jar[download from the Isis website]).

Import using: `File > Import Settings`, and specify the directory that you have downloaded the file to:

.IntelliJ Import Settings - Specify JAR file
image::{_imagesdir}030-import-settings/010-settings-import-jar.png[width="400px"]

Select all the (two) categories of settings available in the JAR file:

.IntelliJ Import Settings - Select all categories
image::{_imagesdir}030-import-settings/020-select-all.png[width="300px"]

And then restart:

.IntelliJ Import Settings - Restart
image::{_imagesdir}030-import-settings/030-restart.png[width="200px"]



### Other Settings

There are also some other miscellaneous settings that we recommend that you adjust (though these are not critical).

First, specify an up-to-date Maven installation, using `File > Settings` (or `IntelliJ > Preferences` if on MacOS):

.IntelliJ Other Settings - Maven Installation
image::{_imagesdir}040-other-settings/010-maven-installation.png[width="600px"]

Still on the Maven settings page, configure as follows:

.IntelliJ Other Settings - Maven Configuration
image::{_imagesdir}040-other-settings/020-maven-configuration.png[width="600px"]

On the compiler settings page, ensure that `build automatically` is enabled (and optionally `compile independent modules in parallel`):

.IntelliJ Other Settings - Compiler Settings
image::{_imagesdir}040-other-settings/030-build-automatically.png[width="600px"]

On the auto import page, check the `optimize imports on the fly` and `add unambiguous imports on the fly`

.IntelliJ Other Settings - Auto Import
image::{_imagesdir}040-other-settings/040-auto-import.png[width="600px"]



### Plugins

You might also want to set up some additional plugins, using `File > Settings > Plugins` (or equivalently `File > Other Settings > Configure Plugins`).

Recommended are:
* link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7179?pr=idea[Maven Helper] plugin
+
Provides better visualization of dependency trees (similar to Eclipse)
* link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin[AsciiDoctor] plugin
+
Useful if you are doing any authoring of documents.

Some others you might like to explore are:

## Importing and Managing Maven Modules

Let's load in some actual code!  We do this by importing the Maven modules.

First up, open up the Maven tool window (`View > Tool Windows > Maven Projects`).  You can then use the 'plus' button to add Maven modules.  In the screenshot you can see we've loaded in Isis core; the modules are listed in the _Maven Projects_ window and corresponding (IntelliJ) modules are shown in the _Projects_ window:

.IntelliJ Maven Module Management - Importing Maven modules
image::{_imagesdir}100-maven-module-mgmt/010-maven-modules-view.png[width="730px"]

We can then import another module (from some other directory).  For example, here we are importing the Isis Addons' todoapp example:

.IntelliJ Maven Module Management - Importing another Module
image::{_imagesdir}100-maven-module-mgmt/020-adding-another-module.png[width="400px"]

You should then see the new Maven module loaded in the _Projects_ window and also the _Maven Projects_ window:

.IntelliJ Maven Module Management -
image::{_imagesdir}100-maven-module-mgmt/030-other-module-added.png[width="730px"]

If any dependencies are already loaded in the project, then IntelliJ will automatically update the CLASSPATH to resolve to locally held modules (rather from `.m2/repository` folder).  So, for example (assuming that the `<version>` is correct, of course), the Isis todoapp will have local dependencies on the Isis core.

You can press F4 (or use `File > Project Structure`) to see the resolved classpath for any of the modules loaded into the project.

If you want to focus on one set of code (eg the Isis todoapp but not Isis core) then you _could_ remove the module; but better is to ignore those modules.  This will remove from the the _Projects_ window but keep them available in the _Maven Projects_ window for when you next want to work on them:

.IntelliJ Maven Module Management - Ignoring Modules
image::{_imagesdir}100-maven-module-mgmt/040-ignoring-modules.png[width="730px"]

Confirm that it's ok to ignore these modules:

.IntelliJ Maven Module Management - Ignoring Modules (ctd)
image::{_imagesdir}100-maven-module-mgmt/050-ignoring-modules-2.png[width="300px"]

All being well you should see that the _Projects_ window now only contains the code you are working on.  Its classpath dependencies will be adjusted (eg to resolve to Isis core from `.m2/repository`):

.IntelliJ Maven Module Management - Updated Projects Window
image::{_imagesdir}100-maven-module-mgmt/060-ignored-modules.png[width="730px"]



## Running

Let's see how to run both the app and the tests.

### Running the App

Once you've imported your Isis application, we should run it.  We do this by creating a Run configuration, using `Run > Edit Configurations`.

Set up the details as follows:

.IntelliJ Running the App - Run Configuration
image::{_imagesdir}110-running-the-app/010-run-configuration.png[width="600px"]

We specify the `Main class` to be `org.apache.isis.WebServer`; this is a wrapper around Jetty.  It's possible to pass program arguments to this (eg to automatically install fixtures), but for now leave this blank.

Also note that `Use classpath of module` is the webapp module for your app, and that the `working directory` is `$MODULE_DIR$`.

Next, and most importantly, configure the DataNucleus enhancer to run for your `dom` goal.  This can be done by defining a Maven goal to run before the app:

.IntelliJ Running the App - Datanucleus Enhancer Goal
image::{_imagesdir}110-running-the-app/020-datanucleus-enhancer-goal.png[width="400px"]

The `-o` flag in the goal means run off-line; this will run faster.

WARNING: if you forget to set up the enhancer goal, or don't run it on the correct (dom) module, then you will get all sorts of errors when you startup.  These usually manifest themselves as class cast exception in DataNucleus.

You should now be able to run the app using `Run > Run Configuration`.  The same configuration can also be used to debug the app if you so need.


### Running the Unit Tests

The easiest way to run the unit tests is just to right click on the `dom` module in the _Project Window_, and choose run unit tests.  Hopefully your tests will pass (!).

.IntelliJ Running the App - Unit Tests Run Configuration
image::{_imagesdir}110-running-the-app/030-running-unit-tests.png[width="600px"]

As a side-effect, this will create a run configuration, very similar to the one we manually created for the main app:

.IntelliJ Running the App - Unit Tests Run Configuration
image::{_imagesdir}110-running-the-app/040-running-unit-tests-run-configuration.png[width="600px"]

Thereafter, you should run units by selecting this configuration (if you use the right click approach you'll end up with lots of run configurations, all similar).

### Running the Integration Tests

Integration tests can be run in the same way as unit tests, however the `dom` module must also have been enhanced.

One approach is to initially run the tests use the right click on the `integtests` module; the tests will fail because the code won't have been enhanced, but we can then go and update the run configuration to run the datanucleus enhancer goal (same as when running the application):

.IntelliJ Running the App - Integration Tests Run Configuration
image::{_imagesdir}110-running-the-app/050-running-integration-tests-run-configuration.png[width="600px"]



## Hints and Tips

### Keyboard Shortcuts Cheat Sheets

You can download 1-page PDFs cheat sheets for IntelliJ's keyboard shortcuts:
* for link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf[Windows]
* for MacOS:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard_Mac.pdf[MacOS]

Probably the most important shortcut on them is for `Find Action`:
- `ctrl-shift-A` on Windows
- `cmd-shift-A` on MacOS.

This will let you search for any action just by typing its name.

### Switching between Tool Windows and Editors

The Tool Windows are the views around the editor (to left, bottom and right).  It's possible to move these around to your preferred locations.

* Use `alt-1` through `alt-9` (or `cmd-1` through `alt-9`) to select the tool windows
** Press it twice and the tool window will hide itself; so can use to toggle
* If in the _Project Window_ (say) and hit enter on a file, then it will be shown in the editor, but (conveniently) the focus remains in the tool window.  To switch to the editor, just press `Esc`.
** If in the _Terminal Window_, you'll need to press `Shift-Esc`.
* If on the editor and want to locate the file in (say) the _Project Window_, use `alt-F1`.
* To change the size of any tool window, use `ctrl-shift-arrow`

Using these shortcuts you can easily toggle between the tool windows and the editor, without using the mouse.  Peachy!

### Navigating Around

For all of the following, you don't need to type every letter, typing "ab" will actually search for ".*a.*b.*".

* to open classes or files or methods that you know the name of:
** `ctrl-N` to open class
** `ctrl-shift-N` to open a file
** (bit fiddly this) `ctrl-shift-alt-N` to search for any symbol.
* open up dialog of recent files: `ctrl-E`
* search for any file: `shift-shift`

Navigating around:
* find callers of a method (the call hierarchy): `ctrl-alt-H`
* find subclasses or overrides: `ctrl-alt-B`
* find superclasses/interface/declaration: `ctrl-B`

Viewing the structure (ie outline) of a class
* `ctrl-F12` will pop-up a dialog showing all members
** hit `ctrl-F12` again to also see inherited members


### Editing

* Extend selection using `ctrl-W`
** and contract it down again using `ctrl-shift-W`
* to duplicate a line, it's `ctrl-D`
** if you have some text selected (or even some lines), it'll actually duplicate the entire selection
* to delete a line, it's `ctrl-X`
* to move a line up or down: `shift-alt-up` and `shift-alt-down`
** if you have selected several lines, it'll move them all togethe
* `ctrl-shift-J` can be handy for joining lines together
** just hit enter to split them apart (even in string quotes; IntelliJ will "do the right thing")

### Intentions and Code Completion

Massively useful is the "Intentions" popup; IntelliJ tries to guess what you might want to do.  You can activate this using`alt-enter`, whenever you see a lightbulb/tooltip in the margin of the current line.

Code completion usually happens whenever you type '.'.  You can also use `ctrl-space` to bring these up.

In certain circumstances (eg in methods0) you can also type `ctrl-shift-space` to get a smart list of methods etc that you might want to call.  Can be useful.

Last, when invoking a method, use `ctrl-P` to see the parameter types.


### Refactoring

Loads of good stuff on the `Refactor` menu; most used are:

* Rename (`shift-F6`)
* Extract
** method: `ctrl-alt-M`
** variable: `ctrl-alt-V`
* Inline method/variable: `ctrl-alt-N`
* Change signature

If you can't remember all those shortcuts, just use `ctrl-shift-alt-T` (might want to rebind that to something else!) and get a context-sensitive list of refactorings available for the currently selected object


### Troubleshooting

When a Maven module is imported, IntelliJ generates its own project files (suffix `.ipr`), and the application is actually built from that.

Occasionally these don't keep in sync (even if auto-import of Maven modules has been enabled).

To fix the issue, try:
* reimport module
* rebuild selected modules/entire project
* remove and then re-add the project
* restart, invalidating caches
* hit StackOverflow (!)

One thing worth knowing; IntelliJ actively scans the filesystem all the time.  It's therefore (almost always) fine to build the app from the Maven command line; IntelliJ will detect the changes and keep in sync.  If you want to force that, use `File > Synchronize`, `ctrl-alt-Y`.


## Advanced

In this section are a couple of options that will reduce the length of the change code/build/deploy/review feedback loop.
