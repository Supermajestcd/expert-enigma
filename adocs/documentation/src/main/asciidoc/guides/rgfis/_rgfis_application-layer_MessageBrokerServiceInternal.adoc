The (internal) `MessageBrokerServiceInternal` domain service is a wrapper around xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_MessageService[`MessageService`].


[NOTE]
====
As of `1.15.0-SNAPSHOT` this service has been removed; it does does not provide any additional capabilities over and those of `MessageService`.
====





== SPI

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface MessageBrokerServiceInternal {
    void informUser(String message);
    void warnUser(String message);
    void raiseError(String message);
}
----


== Runtime vs Noop implementation

The framework provides two implementations:

* `MessageBrokerServiceInternalDefault` is provided by `isis-core-runtime`, and is used during normal use and integration tests

* `MessageBrokerServiceInternalNoop` is provided as a fallback by `isis-core-metamodel`, and is provided to allow the xref:../rgmvn/rgmvn.adoc#[maven plugin] to be bootstrapped without any "backend" database.

The `...Default` implementation takes priority over the `...Noop` implementation.
