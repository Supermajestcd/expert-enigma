Whenever a view model is to be rendered, the framework fires off an CSS class UI event to obtain a CSS class to use in any wrapping ``<div>``s and ``<span>``s that render the domain object.

This attribute is the same as xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainObjectLayout_cssClass[`@DomainObjectLayout#cssClass()`], but for view models instead of entities.

A default event that is emitted if none specified, unless the `isis.reflector.facet.viewModelLayoutAnnotation.cssClassUiEvent.postForDefault` configuration property is set to "false".
