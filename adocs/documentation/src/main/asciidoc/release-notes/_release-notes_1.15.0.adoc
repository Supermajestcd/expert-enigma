[NOTE]
====
Apache Isis 1.15.0-SNAPSHOT is currently still in development
====


The main new feature is inline prompts: the ability to edit a property or invoke an action (associated with a property) without requiring a modal dialog box.
There have also been several improvements in the ability to tab around the UI.

The version of Apache Wicket has also been upgraded from `6.x` to `7.x`.

Most applications written against v1.14.x should run against v1.15.0 with few if any changes.
That said, we do recommend that you read and keep in mind the xref:migration-notes#_migration-notes_1.14.0-to-1.15.0.adoc[migration notes] when you upgrade your app.
