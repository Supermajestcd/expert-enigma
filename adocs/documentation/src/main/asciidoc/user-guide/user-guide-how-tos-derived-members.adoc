.Inlining query-only repository action
****
While derived properties and derived collections typically "walk the graph" to associated objects, there is nothing to prevent the returned value being the result of invoking a repository (domain service) action.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    ...
    public List<Order> getMostRecentOrders() {
        return orderRepo.findMostRecentOrders(this, 5);
    }
}
----
