## Configuration Files

Isis' own configuration properties are simple key-value pairs, typically held in in the `WEBINF/isis.properties` file.

## Configuring the Webapp

When running an Isis webapp, configuration properties are read from configuration files held in the `WEB-INF` directory.

### Isis configuration

The `WEBINF/isis.properties` file is always read and must exist.

In addition, the following other properties are searched for and if present also read:

* `viewer_wicket.properties` - if the Wicket UI (viewer) is in use
* `viewer_restfulobjects.properties` - if the Restful Objects REST API (viewer) is in use
* `viewer.properties` - for any shared UI configuration
* `persistor_datanucleus.properties` - assuming the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore is in use
* `persistor.properties` - for any shared objectstore configuration.  This typically is used to hold `JDBC` ``URL``s

### Shiro configuration

`WEB-INF/shiro.ini`

### Configuring Isis to use Shiro

For more on some specific use cases, see <<Configuring Shiro>>


### JDO/DataNucleus configuration

Any Isis properties with the prefix `isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl` are passed through directly to the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore (with the prefix stripped off, of course).

DataNucleus will itself search for additional XML mapping files, eg `mappings.jdo`.  These an be used to override any annotations of annotated entities.

## Configuring the Integration Tests

Integration tests are configured programmatically, with a default set of properties to bootstrap the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore using an HSQLDB in-memory database.

These can be overridden by subclassing `IsisConfigurationForJdoIntegTests`.
