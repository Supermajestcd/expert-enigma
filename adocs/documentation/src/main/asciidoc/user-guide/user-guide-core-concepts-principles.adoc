## Domain-Driven Design

### Ubiquitous Language



## Naked Objects Pattern

[TIP]
.Object Interface Mapping
====
Just as an ORM (such as link:http://datanucleus.org[DataNucleus] or link:http:hibernate.org[Hibernate]) maps domain entities to a database, you can think of Naked Objects as an OIM - mapping domain objects to a user interface.

* multiple UIs.



## Hexagonal Architecture

Originally described by Alistair Cockburn, the link:http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture[Hexagonal Architecture] ...

[TIP]
====
The hexagonal architecture is also known as the link:http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PortsAndAdaptersArchitecture:[Ports and Adapters] architecture or (less frequently) as the link:http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/[Onion] architecture.

## Decoupled Modules

Using:

* dependency injection of services
* OO design techniques, eg dependency inversion principle
* an in-memory event bus
* applib

.Aspect Oriented
****
Although not implemented using an aspect-oriented language such as AspectJ, Isis takes considerable inspiration from AOP concepts.

For example, the UI visualization automatically provided by Isis can be thought of (and is!) treating the UI as a cross-cutting concern.

Isis' also has support for traits/mixins through its <<Contributions>>.  This allows functionality from one class (a domain service) to be rendered as if it belongs to another (a domain object).


* aspect-oriented design, such as traits/mix-ins (see <<Contributions>>) and interceptors and UI visualization as a cross-cutting concern
****



## Focuses on its Key Responsibilities

* Isis is at heart a metamodel with runtime, and coordinates interations using an AOP set of principles
* Apache Isis vs Isis Addons
* Apache Isis vs Shiro vs DataNucleus



## Testable Applications

While Apache Isis can be used (very effectively) for simple CRUD-style applications, it is also intended to be used for complex business domains.  Ensuring that the business logic in such applications is correct means that the framework must (and does) provide robust testing support, both for developer-level unit testing and business-level (end-to-end) integration testing.
