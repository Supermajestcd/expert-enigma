If providing an action that will perform irreversible changes, include a
mandatory boolean parameter that must be explicitly checked by the end-user
in order for the action to proceed.

== Screenshots

For example:

image::{_imagesdir}/user-guide-how-tos-tips-n-tricks-are-you-sure.png[]

If the user checks the box:

image::{_imagesdir}/user-guide-how-tos-tips-n-tricks-are-you-sure-happy-case.png[]

then the action will complete.

However, if the user fails to check the box, then a validation message is shown:

image::{_imagesdir}/user-guide-how-tos-tips-n-tricks-are-you-sure-sad-case.png[]

== Code example

The code for this is pretty simple:

[source,java]
----
public List<ToDoItem> delete(@Named("Are you sure?") boolean areYouSure) {

    container.removeIfNotAlready(this);

    container.informUser("Deleted " + container.titleOf(this));

    // invalid to return 'this' (cannot render a deleted object)
    return toDoItems.notYetComplete(); 
}
public String validateDelete(boolean areYouSure) {
    return areYouSure? null: "Please confirm you are sure";
}
----

Note that the action itself does not use the boolean parameter, it is only
used by the supporting `validateXxx()` method.
