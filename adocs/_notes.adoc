I'm thinking that initially we just use antora for the reference and user guides, but leave the top-level as is.

The table-of-contents could probably become the ROOT module.




== docs.antora.org

Looking at how docs.antora.org works:

* playbook in https://gitlab.com/antora/docs.antora.org[]

** named (`antora-playbook.yml` rather than the usual `site.yml`, so build using `antora antora-playbook.yml`

** also includes `docsearch` for their nice search capability

* single module (multiple branches) is the codebase itself, ie https://gitlab.com/antora/antora[]

** in particular, https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/tree/master/docs[/tree/master/docs] subdir.

** holds `antora.yml` which is the module descriptor


In the module we see the required (opinionated) module structure.
