The framework provides a number of "aggregator" POMs that act as a convenient way to aggregate together various common dependencies.

For example, when writing unit tests for your domain app, it can simply depend on the `isis-mavendeps-unittests` artifact (rather than have to reference all of JUnit, AssertJ, Spring Boot, Hamcrest, Mockito and so on).

Currently five aggregator POMs are provided.

== Webapp

The `isis-mavendeps-webapp` aggregates the main runtime dependencies of a production webapp.
Note however that it does _not_ include the runtime dependencies for either JDO or JPA; these have their own "mavendeps" POM, discussed xref:#jdo-and-jpa[below].

To use, add the following :

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-webapp</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

For convenience, it includes all of the current components available:

* Spring Boot (link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started-first-application-dependencies[spring-boot-starter-web])

* Apache Isis Core - the xref:refguide:ROOT:about.adoc[Applib] and underlying implementation (xref:core:runtime-services:about.adoc[Runtime Services])

* Two of the security implementations (xref:security:bypass:about.adoc[Bypass] and  xref:security:keycloak:about.adoc[Keycloak])
+
The xref:security:shiro:about.adoc[Shiro] and xref:security:spring:about.adoc[Spring] implementations are omitted, as each of these have additional third-party dependencies.

* All the viewer implementations (xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket], xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects])

// doesn't seem to include these...
//* All the persistence implementations (xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus], xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/EclipseLink])

If you don't need any of these (for example, you'll probably only want one security implementation), then you can exclude the others.

Also, remember that adding the class onto the classpath does _not_ make that functionality available (Apache Isis does not currently leverage Spring Boot's link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-auto-configuration[auto configuration] capabilities).
So, you must also add in the appropriate `IsisModuleXxx` to your application's top-level link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html[@Configuration] (aka "app manifest").
For example, see the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc#appmanifest[AppManifest for the SimpleApp] starter app.


== Testing

Three aggregator POMs are provided to support  xref:testing:unittestsupport:about.adoc[unit testing], xref:testing:integtestsupport:about.adoc[integ testing] or running xref:testing:specsupport:about.adoc[BDD (Cucumber) specs].

To use them when unit testing, add:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-unittests</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

For integration testing, add:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-integtests</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
