The framework provides a number of "aggregator" POMs that act as a convenient way to aggregate together various common dependencies.

For example, when writing unit tests for your domain app, it can simply depend on the `isis-mavendeps-unittests` artifact (rather than have to reference all of JUnit, AssertJ, Spring Boot, Hamcrest, Mockito and so on).

Currently five aggregator POMs are provided.

== Webapp

The `isis-mavendeps-webapp` aggregates the main runtime dependencies of a production webapp.
Note however that it does _not_ include the runtime dependencies for either JDO or JPA; these have their own "mavendeps" POM, discussed xref:#jdo-and-jpa[below].

To use, add the following :

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-webapp</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

For convenience, it includes all of the current components available:

* Spring Boot (link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started-first-application-dependencies[spring-boot-starter-web])

* Apache Isis Core - the xref:refguide:ROOT:about.adoc[Applib] and underlying implementation (xref:core:runtime-services:about.adoc[Runtime Services])

* All the security implementations (xref:security:bypass:about.adoc[Bypass],xref:security:shiro:about.adoc[Shiro] and  xref:security:keycloak:about.adoc[Keycloak])

* All the viewer implementations (xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket], xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects])

// doesn't seem to include these...
//* All the persistence implementations (xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus], xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/EclipseLink])

If you don't need any of these (for example, you'll probably only want one security implementation), then you can exclude the others.

Also, remember that adding the class onto the classpath does _not_ make that functionality available (Apache Isis does not currently leverage Spring Boot's link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-auto-configuration[auto configuration] capabilities).
So, you must also add in the appropriate `IsisModuleXxx` to your application's top-level link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html[@Configuration] (aka "app manifest").
For example, see the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc#appmanifest[AppManifest for the SimpleApp] starter app.


[#jdo-and-jpa]
== JDO and JPA

The `isis-mavendeps-jdo` aggregates the xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] dependencies, while the `isis-mavendeps-jpa` similarly aggregates the xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/EclipseLink] dependencies.
Applications should use one or the other:

* to use JDO, add:
+
[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-jdo</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

* to use JPA, add:
+
[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-jpa</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

== Testing and BDD Specs

Three aggregator POMs are provided to support  xref:testing:unittestsupport:about.adoc[unit testing], xref:testing:integtestsupport:about.adoc[integ testing] or running xref:testing:specsupport:about.adoc[BDD (Cucumber) specs].

To use them when unit testing, add:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-unittests</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

For integration testing, add:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-integtests</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

For BDD (Cucumber) specs, within an integration testing context:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-integspecs</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

The table below summarises the dependencies that each of these aggregator POMs brings in.

== jdk11

While Apache Isis v2 will run happily on Java 8, it is of course also possible to it on later versions.

However, between Java 8 and Java 11 a number of packages related to JavaEE were removed from the JRE, but these packages are used by the framework, specifically

* JAX-WS packages (`javax.jws`, `javax.jws.soap`, `javax.xml.soap`, and `javax.xml.ws.*`)
* JAXB packages (`javax.xml.bind.*`)

So, if you _do_ want to run your Apache Isis application on Java 11 or later, then these dependencies need to be added in.


All you need to do is include this dependency in the webapp module:

To use, add the following :

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-mavendeps-jdk11</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

If you are running on JDK11, then this will activate a profile to bring in the missing packages.
Otherwise it will be ignored.
