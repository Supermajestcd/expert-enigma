CAUTION: TODO v2 - to document.  AbstractIsisInteractionTemplate has been removed.

* Implementation of a Quartz `Job` interface:
+
[source,java]
.DemoJob.java
----
include::example$DemoJob.java[tags=class]
----
+
Domain services (such as `IsisConfiguration`) can be injected into this class.

* The job calls a subclass of `AbstractIsisInteractionTemplate` to perform the work.
This runs within a transactionm under the user and role specified by `DemoJob`, above:
+
.DemoIsisInteractionTemplate.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$DemoIsisInteractionTemplate.java[tags=class]
----

* Finally, the job is configured to run using Spring:
+
.DemoJobQuartzConfigurerModule.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$DemoJobQuartzConfigurerModule.java[tags=class]
----
