= Restful Objects Viewer

Apache Isis' Restful Objects viewer is an implementation of the link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec],
which defines a generic way to expose a domain model through a REST (or more precisely, hypermedia) API.  Having a REST
API opens up an Apache Isis domain model to a huge variety of applications, from bespoke single-page apps,
through integration scenarios, through providing an API for bulk-upload/migration from an existing system.

The Restful Objects viewer also provides a number of extensions specific to Apache Isis.  Most significant of these is
enhanced content negotiation support, making it easier to use the returned representations within bespoke clients using
standard third-party configurations.

This user guide discuss features, configuration and also how to extend the Restful Objects viewer.
